[ug1-students] Updated InfBase link

---------------

Hi all, 

Our InfBase session link had to be updated again: https://eu.bbcollab.com/guest/1462dd2731594fd8bea1454032514bc9

I can’t explain why this session just vanishes some time. Please do let me know if a session is not working and look up the current link online: https://informaticsstudentsupport.wordpress.com/

cheers!
