Heyoooo! Reps here!

I`d like to say that this email wasn`t sent yesterday because of hurricane or flood but no, I was just being a forgetful rep. BUT. There is your promised link about the CL !informal! revision date.

Choose wisely, dear comrades…

Always yours,

Irina & the reps

P.S. I promise to be a good rep from now on and don`t forget anything.

P.P.S. We still ❤ you
