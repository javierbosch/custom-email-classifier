[Inf1a-students] Tutorial 9
---------------
I’ve just posted the promised update of tutorial 9.

Apologies that I didn’t get it out earlier.

The main change is that the tutorial now makes proper use of Data.Set

That said I I have also provided more structure for the answers, and revised the text.

As usual, any comments gratefully received.

Best,

Michael
