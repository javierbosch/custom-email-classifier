Dear Javi,

I’m just reviewing results on FAC, and I can see that you’ve passed the course – well done!

Your overall result is currently 88% (subject to approval by the Exam Board in January). This is based on:

Final Test (20% of course): 100%

Unit Tests (80% of course): 85% - based on 10 Mastery (of which 8 Distinction)

Best wishes,

George
