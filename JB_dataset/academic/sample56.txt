Industrial action is starting on Monday 25 November

Dear student,

   

I am writing to remind you that industrial action will, regrettably, be taking place from next Monday 25th November. This is due to a dispute over pay and pensions between the university and college sector nationally and one of the staff trade unions, the University and College Union (UCU).  




UCU have announced action as follows:




*	Continuous Action Short of a Strike from 25 November 2019 (examples of these actions include working to contract, not covering for absent colleagues, not sharing materials relating to lectures or classes cancelled as a result of strike, not rescheduling lectures or classes, and not undertaking voluntary duties)
*	Strike action from 25-29 November and 2-4 December 2019




Our priority is to minimise disruption to your learning and teaching throughout this period. To inform and support you, we have posted a series of Frequently Asked Questions on our website to answer many of the queries you may have. These include information on teaching, assessment, library services, exams and support services as well as background to the dispute itself and the reasons for it. 




Industrial Action FAQs for students <https://mailings.ed.ac.uk/27JU-1I5MI-9FSYIA-Z3VYZ-1/c.aspx> 




During the industrial action, you should work on the basis that your studies will continue as normal, unless you are told otherwise. This means that you should aim to attend scheduled teaching, complete and submit assessments by the relevant deadlines, and continue to plan for any examinations. All of our graduation November ceremonies are scheduled and expected to go ahead as planned.




We will continue to update these FAQs regularly and email you when developments occur. You can also keep up to date on our Student News Facebook <https://mailings.ed.ac.uk/27JU-1I5MI-9FSYIA-Z3VE2-1/c.aspx>  and Twitter <https://mailings.ed.ac.uk/27JU-1I5MI-9FSYIA-Z3VE3-1/c.aspx>  pages.




If you have any general questions regarding the industrial action you can also email:

Best wishes,




Professor Colm Harmon
