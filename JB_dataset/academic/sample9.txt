CLEANING SERVICES: In the interest of protecting our staff, all cleaning services have now stopped.  It would be appreciated if you could ensure you and your neighbours are considerate, and for hygiene purposes, remove waste from your home to external bins for the duration of the lockdown.  In the kitchens at O’Shea Residence Halls, additional sanitiser will be provided for use before and after food preparation.  

SECURITY AWARENESS: Please continue good security measures by ensuring doors and windows are locked if you are away from your room for any period of time.  DO NOT PASS YOUR KEYS TO ANYBODY ELSE.  Please remember that you are mutually responsible with other flat mates for communal areas. You will be held liable for any damage caused by guests, so be sensible about who you invite into your flat. 

REPAIRS: At this point our colleagues and contractors are only responding to emergency repairs which pose a risk to life or the safety/security of your home.  Should you believe you need an emergency repair, please contact Community Support.

PARCELS:  During the period of lockdown, ACE will be unable to store parcels securely at usual parcel holding areas at Pollock Halls, O’Shea Residence Hall and Richmond Place.  We would urge you to consider the necessity of the order as items may be held in areas which are accessible by others.

PARCELS AT POLLOCK: For parcels already processed, please enter reception through front doors. There will be signage directing you to the parcel room where parcels are labelled in number order. Large parcels are placed on floor. 

For new parcels, these will be placed into containers labelled by house name. You will not receive email notification for these but will normally receive an email from the courier. You can take your parcels from the bins.

PARCELS AT RICHMOND PLACE/DEACONESS/ROXBURGH AND O’SHEA RESIDENCE HALL:  You will shortly receive a communication from the Property Team asking that you make contact with couriers to ask that you are called by the driver on their arrival.

EMERGENCIES: In the event of an emergency, please contact Community on 0131 667 1971. If you require the emergency services, you should immediately dial 999, and then contact Community Support thereafter.
