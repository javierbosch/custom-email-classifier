Hi Javier,
It was very nice having a meeting with you today, as Jonathan said we want to keep in touch with you. If you want to delve deeper into the machine learning topic I have some general recomendations. Once we assemble the full team and decide what we are working on exactly I will also provide some more specific materials. 


First there is a really nice youtube channel https://www.3blue1brown.com/ <https://www.3blue1brown.com/> . He has a series on neural networks which I definetely recomend. The series on calculus and linear algebra might also be useful for full understanding and you will have those topics in your courses anyway so it is pobably worth looking at them. As for programming it is good you know some python as it will probably be the main language we use. It would be great if you had a look at some basic libraries such as numpy, matplotlib and scikit. Let me know if any area interestes you specifically and I might be able to give you some recomendations. Also wikipedia is always a nice starting point ðŸ˜‰. 


Best,
Marcin

Hola Javier,


my name is Jonathan and I work with Clara on the GreenTech startup. I'm currently doing my PhD in AI and had a couple of startups of my own.
I would love to meet up with you to talk about your ML and image recognition background and how you could fit into the startup.
We could meet up today between 4-5pm, tomorrow between 1-3pm or Wednesday after 1.30pm.

Please let me know what fits you.

Kindest regards
Jonathan
