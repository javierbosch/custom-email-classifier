Hullo all.

Several of you have asked about answers for the mock, and for last year’s paper.

I don’t propose to provide these.

Your efforts should not be focussed on the answers, but rather on the question and 
the process of moving from question to answer. You have plenty of examples of questions with
answers — a few more will not help you

At this stage, you should first be thinking about how to start each type of problem; and then how 
you should continue. Seeing the correct answer is often a distraction from that — you can follow 
the working for a particular example, without being able to generalise to other examples.

You should be looking at the questions for which you don’t have answers, and trying to see 
what they have in common with the many, many questions for which you do have answers.

I hope this helps,

Michael
