[Inf1a-students] CL2 Lab/ tutorial
---------------
I’m either elated or concerned to see no discussion of this on Piazza. 
If that means you have no problems with these exercises, then I rejoice!
However, if it means you’re only working on FP3, then I think you should  remember that, for most of you, your CL lab comes before your FP tutorial. Please prepare — and ask questions on Piazza if you have *any* problems.
