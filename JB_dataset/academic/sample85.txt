		Hello, Clara,

		My name is Javier Bosch and I am a first year student of Computer Science and Maths. 
		I saw that you were looking for co-founders for a startup, and I personally see myself as a perfect fit.

		I am deeply invest in the climate crisis issue (I have been a Greenpeace volunteer since I was 15), and I have always wanted to do my bit from a computer science point.
		You might be interested on some of my previous experience with AI or image recognition. Therefore I attached to this email the two parts of a project I presented in Jugend Forscht Iberia and in Nordrhein-Westfalen (as you studied in Germany I am sending you the original version). 
		About working experience, I did an internship for three months on a software company (https://goldenrace.com <https://goldenrace.com/> ) when I was 17, I learnt how to work in specialised teams.
		I'm a hard-worker, and I love working with other, specially when we are working goal oriented.

		If you find the fact that I'm a first year unappealing, I encourage you to please read the attached documents and to consider that I have got more free time than other applicants, and I love to invest it in this project.

		Best regards,
		Javier
