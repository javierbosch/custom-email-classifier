Would you like to know more about Trendence? Here’s some extra information:

The Trendence Graduate study is the UK’s most comprehensive piece of research into students’ views on graduate careers and recruitment: over 74,000 UK students took part last year. Trendence also powers The UK 300, so ranking your favourite employers is a great way to influence their status in the publication. 

Trendence is an excellent tool for helping students to think about graduate careers: the questions require you to rank employers in a variety of ways, helping you to think laterally about your career options and why you like, or don’t like, certain companies. 

Your answers are completely anonymous. You are welcome to read our privacy policy which can be found here <https://groupgti.com/privacy/trendence> . 

Trendence abides by all MRS codes, ESOMAR codes and ISO 20252. We are conducting this survey in partnership with your Careers Service.
