Message from the Head of College





Welcome to the start of the new academic year! I’m delighted to have the opportunity to open this first newsletter of the academic year 2019/20, and would especially like to extend a warm welcome to those students joining us for their first year of academic study at the University of Edinburgh. We are delighted once again to be welcoming a truly diverse and international cohort across our taught and research programmes, with representation from over 120 countries. 

This is an especially exciting academic year for the College as we prepare to mark the centenary of King's Buildings Campus in 2020. On 6 July 2020, we will mark the anniversary on which King George V laid the foundation stone for the first of the buildings that would form part of the University of Edinburgh’s new science campus. We have a wonderful year-long celebration planned from July, with a range of events which will celebrate the King's Buildings campus and the achievements of our students and staff.

Professor Dave Robertson

Head of College


Our College, and in particular the King's Buildings  Campus, continues to develop and you will notice that there is a significant amount of investment taking place across campus, including the building works associated with the KB Nucleus, Darwin Building development, our new al-fresco barbecue area and even the development of a KB Community Garden! Closer to the city centre, we are delighted to see the increasing importance of the Bayes Centre to Data Science in Scotland. With such significant development and improvement taking place, we want to make sure you are up-to-date with the status of the planned works and any potential changes to routes around campus, so please take some time to read about our campus developments below. We will use this newsletter as a primary means of updating you on developments throughout the academic year, so do make sure you read it when it is circulated.

Whether you are embarking on a new programme or continuing your studies with us, we want to ensure you have the best possible experience. There are many ways you can get involved and share your views, including standing for nomination as an elected Programme Representative or School Representative through the EUSA elections, passing your views to elected representatives for discussion at School Student-Staff Liaison Committees (SSLC) or our new College SSLC, or working in partnership with staff to enhance your experience through a Student Partnership Agreement Project. However you choose to get involved, we want to hear your voice!

UK Student Space Conference




The UoE Physics & Astronomy society hosted the UK Student Space Conference in June. The event was organised by UK Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (UKSEDS), the UK’s national student space society. 





The two-day conference brought together students, employers and speakers from a range of space-related fields. The purpose of the event was to raise awareness of the space sector and the opportunities it offers students and graduates.

Shuttle Bus to continue in 2019/20



The decision has been taken to continue with all existing transport arrangements including the King's Buildings shuttle bus until the end of the 2019/20 academic year. In addition, a new partial 41 service to and from Buccleuch Terrace will run in the mornings and evenings during rush hours.




Within King's Buildings, the bus stop will be relocated in the coming weeks from the Roger Land Building to outside Murchison House.

King's Buildings construction work 





Anyone who works or studies at King's Buildings will be aware of the various building projects that are happening across the campus at the moment. They are all part of the long-term plan to transform and upgrade the campus, often referred to as the King's Buildings Masterplan.





At the heart of the campus, demolition has begun at the old KB Centre to enable the construction of a new campus hub called the Nucleus. Unfortunately, there will be periods of noise from this work which may impact on Library users. If this affects your ability to use the Library as a study space we recommend Murchison House at the western edge of the campus as an alternative. Study spaces are available on the basement, ground and first floors.




Another major project at the south east of the campus is the building of the new Darwin and Hive Buildings which will see the construction of a new complex for the School of Biological Sciences. 





In addition to the creation of new modern buildings, an essential upgrade to underground infrastructure is needed. This has resulted in several trenches being opened across the campus to carry out this work. This project is now entering its latter stages so its impact on staff and students should soon be nearing an end.




The creation of new accessible entrances to the front of the Grant Institute and the Joseph Black Building are also nearing completion.





We apologise in advance for any inconvenience any of this necessary work may cause you as you use the campus. We are working closely with other University departments to minimise any impact this may have on your time at King's Buildings.

KB100 Photography competition





In July 2020 the College will begin a year of events celebrating the centenary of the opening of The King’s Buildings campus by George V in 1920.




As part of that celebration we are announcing a photography competition for University students and staff. 





The competition is intended to be as open as possible: images can cover all aspects of life and work relating to the College of Science and Engineering, either at King’s Buildings or in any other of our science facilities across the city. Subjects can be of anything including landscapes, buildings, people, animals or flora and fauna. We encourage you to be creative: capture snapshots of staff and student life, and research or course-related activities: including lab work, experiments or field trips.

 <https://i.emlfiles4.com/cmpimg/4/2/7/2/2/1/files/imagecache/2417984/w660_1452439_photographer300.jpg> 	

The competition is now open, and will run until 9th October 2020, giving entrants a full range of seasons, as well as a full academic year in which to capture innovative, creative and inspiring pictures, celebrating our College, one hundred years after the opening of King's Buildings.




Winning images will be displayed online and in a campus exhibition. There will be a range of awards, with a first prize with a value of £500. For more information about the competition, follow the link below.

Peer Learning & Support





The Edinburgh University Students' Association support two types of peer projects – Peer Assisted Learning Schemes and Peer Support Schemes.

In Peer Assisted Learning Schemes (PALS), trained volunteers in second year and above plan and run study sessions for other students. These academic sessions cover a variety of topics, including settling into University life, study skills, course content, module choices, and assessment.

Peer Support Schemes have a more pastoral or community-building focus. They aim to build a sense of community, enhance student wellbeing and enrich the University experience. Trained Student Leaders run regular social activities, well-being and academic focused sessions.

Student tutors make their mark in city schools

Last academic year Edinburgh University students from the Schools of GeoSciences and Mathematics gave up their time to tutor at city schools where relatively few pupils go on to higher education.

Known as The Elevator Project, it provided one-to-one sessions to help school pupils attain the grades they needed to get into university and the world of work.

Pupils from Craigroyston Community High School and Tynecastle High School worked with their personal tutors for one hour each week in individually tailored sessions.

"All of the pupils who have taken part really appreciated the support. I have a really good feeling about this fabulous project and what a positive impact it will have." Lynn Brown, Teacher at Craigroyston Community High School.

Student stories

Hyperloop success




For the third year in a row HYPED, the student society of Hyperloop engineers and developers, made it to the finals of SpaceX's Hyperloop competition in California. 





Hyperloop is Elon Musk’s concept for the future of mass transportation. The concept would see electrically propelled pods travel autonomously through a near-vacuum tube. 




Thousands of university teams enter globally each year and only 21 make the finals. This year HYPED were the only UK team to reach the finals, well done!

Chemistry postgraduate prize winner





Euan Doidge has won this year's Norma and Fraser Stoddart Prize at the School of Chemistry.





Euan gave a talk at the award ceremony entitled "WEEE are Golden: metal recovery by solvent extraction" which covered his research experiences and his passion for teaching and science communication.




Stoddart Prize winners are expected not only to have demonstrated superior research accomplishments throughout their time at Edinburgh but they should also have contributed to the life of students within the School of Chemistry and beyond. 





Professor Sir Fraser Stoddart was co-winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contribution to molecular machine research.

Undergraduate success in Quant competition 





Andrew Markham, a third year undergraduate at the School of Chemistry, came second in the UK in an international quantitative finance competition.




The International Quant Championship takes place on WorldQuant’s intuitive, web-based simulation platform, WebSim, an online environment where users can translate ideas for predicting the movement of financial markets. This year saw over 20,000 participant enter, representing 3,000 universities across 140 countries.

The highest placed nine UK teams presented their top three mathematical models to a panel of WorldQuant judges. The participants' presentation score was added to the score they had generated on our WebSim platform and Matthew achieved second place in the UK, a huge achievement.
