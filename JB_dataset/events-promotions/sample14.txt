Dear Javi,




Voting in the Student's Association's Elections is open until 5pm on Thursday 12 March. Every single student has a vote, so please do have your say on who will speak up on your behalf and represent you at the University and beyond. You can vote online at the Students’ Association website <https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/elections> . 




Here’s my short message with Andrew Wilson, Students' Association President, on why we think it’s important to use your vote.
