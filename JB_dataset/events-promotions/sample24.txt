CreatED 2020 Applications Now Open!!
We are happy to announce that applications for CreatED 2020 are officially open! Come join us over 24 hours for the UK's only hardware hackathon where every hack involves at least one piece of cool hardware. This is to encourage you to explore new technologies and develop a variety of new skills throughout the event.

Whether you are a beginner or a more experienced hacker, everyone is welcome and there will be plenty of opportunities to learn new skills during our workshops. 

We are being sponsored by a wide variety of exciting companies eager for you to participate, including Huawei, Nexmo, Digital Ocean and more! A full list of our awesome sponsors can be found on our website <https://github.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ae7e52910438d3be742a49de7&id=b5dc5e9868&e=d36cbcb0a0>  .

We are also recruiting volunteers to help out during the weekend of the CreatED as we can always use and extra pair of hands.
