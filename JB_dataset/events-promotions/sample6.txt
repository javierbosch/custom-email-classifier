A message from the Head of College




It’s strange to begin by asking how you are but this is somewhere in our thoughts constantly at present.  I hope you are well and, although constrained by the current lockdown, that you’re still feeling fit, energetic and optimistic about the future.  The last few weeks have been difficult because each of us, individually, has had to scramble to find the right positioning (physically and mentally) for a long phase of seclusion while also getting on with key parts of our lives.  For many of you that involves exams, which we’ve rapidy adapted to be supportive as we reasonably can of your ability to be assessed in these very challenging and unexpected circumstances. I hope these go well for you if you’ve still got some to take and I look forward to graduations (virtual or physical depending on how things go) for those of you who are completing.

The Head of College with his dog Toby

Over summer, for those of you continuing, I hope you get a bit more “normality” and the chance to see family and friends in person.  Across College, we’ll be redoubling our efforts to make our style of education more adaptive to your needs because we realise that the world will have changed substantially for next academic year and you may want more innovative ways of learning.  We’re enthusiastic about this and we have plans to do more with new forms of content and new styles of learning, without compromising on the depth and quality of the experience.  I look forward to seeing you in September, after we’ve all had a chance to reinvigorate.

 

In the meantime, stay safe and be happy!  Enjoy the summer sunshine when you can.

Exams

Open-book and take home exams




The University’s move to online exams for Honours and PGT students represents a major shift for most students from formal, invigilated exams to open-book, take home exams. 




The Study Hub Blog has a new three part mini-series which looks at the pros and cons of open-book exams and offers some practical and effective advice to successfully completing them.

Exam Bootcamp




Whatever form your final year assessments will take, you will need to prepare and consolidate your learning. Exam Bootcamp can help you tackle exams and final assessments, learn how to prepare and revise, and develop effective strategies.




Exam Bootcamp is available as a self-enrol course via Learn. The course can be found via the Self-Enrol section of the Learn space.

Updates from around the College




King's Buildings development work




All non-essential on-site construction activities at King’s Buildings are currently paused in line with government guidance. As a result, delays are inevitable to the large-scale building projects at King’s Buildings. We will update you with more information on the likely length of these delays when we know more.




Meanwhile, essential workers within the Estates Department continue to work on University campuses providing security, essential maintenance and cleaning. The King's Buildings campus grounds remain open for local residents taking daily exercise.

KB100 - King's Buildings centenary




Due to the Covid-19 pandemic we are currently revising our schedule for KB100 - the centenary celebration of King's Buildings and the College.




The original programme of events spanned the period from July 2020 to June 2021. We are now looking to push that back to a new time frame however given the uncertainty surrounding how the pandemic will develop we can't say exactly when that will be but will let you know as soon as we can.
