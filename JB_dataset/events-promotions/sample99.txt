[Students] DEVELOPER STUDENT CLUB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH
---------------
A warm welcome to all the new students joining us  and a hearty welcome to those returning for yet another amazing academic year. I come bearing gifts üéÅüéâüéäüéâüéÅ.

 

This academic year, would you like to:

*	Grow your knowledge on developer technologies and more through peer to peer workshops and events.
*	Gain relevant industry experience by solving problems for local organizations with technology based solutions.
*	Showcase your prototypes and solutions to local community and industry leaders.
*	Learn new technologies in a fun relaxed environment.

 

Then Developer Student Club is the place to be. Developer Student Clubs are international clubs which are part of the Google Developer Ecosystem spanning many universities that help train thousands of developers globally. You can read more about DSCs here <https://developers.google.com/community/dsc/> . My name is Gabriel Ohowa Owino <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohowagabrielowino/> , 2nd year B.Eng. Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering and I am the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs DSC Lead tasked with bringing the DSC experience to university of Edinburgh. We aim to host several technical workshops and a series of talks from top industry engineers that will help each and every one advance their career as a developer. From User Experience Design; to mobile and app development; to Distributed programming, there is something for everyone.

 

If you wish to be a part of this amazing experience this year,  all you need to do is follow the following simple steps.

In order to make this experience more delightful, I am currently looking for volunteers to work with me in the following roles. I have outlined brief descriptions about them.
