Recent years have witnessed the development of a wide range of computational tools that process and generate natural language text. Many of these have become familiar to mainstream computer users in the from of web search, question answering, sentiment analysis, and notably machine translation.

 

In this talk Professor Lapata will argue that in order to render electronic data more accessible to individuals and computers alike, new types of translation models need to be developed. Focussing on three examples, text simplification, source code generation, and movie summarization. Illustrating how recent advances in deep learning can be extended in order to induce general representations for different modalities and learn how to translate between these and natural language.
