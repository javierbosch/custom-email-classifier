Your responses will (anonymously) be fed back to employers so they can have a better understanding of your expectations and their brand image. Have your voice heard and you could be in the chance of winning …

Would you like to know more about Trendence? Here’s some extra information:

The Trendence Graduate study is the UK’s most comprehensive piece of research into students’ views on graduate careers and recruitment: over 74,000 UK students took part last year. Trendence also powers The UK 300, so ranking your favourite employers is a great way to influence their status in the publication. 

Trendence is an excellent tool for helping students to think about graduate careers: the questions require you to rank employers in a variety of ways, helping you to think laterally about your career options and why you like, or don’t like, certain companies.
