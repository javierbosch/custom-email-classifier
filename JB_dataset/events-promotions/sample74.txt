Dear School of Informatics members, 

 

my name is Clara and I am a postgrad in Environmental Sustainability at UoE with an undergrad in Business Administration at LMU in Germany. 

 

I have a startup idea for which I am looking for co-founders, who would help me to validate the idea by building the first prototype. The aim is to develop a product, which solves a waste recycling issue and based on this to start a company. 

 

I am looking for someone, who

*	is passionate about entrepreneurship.
*	has some practical experiences or did some project work.
*	has experiences with at least one of the technologies AI, image recognition or sensors.
*	is communicative and able to express his/her ideas.
*	likes to work in a team and to take responsibility.

 

If that sounds like a problem worth solving to you, please drop me an email (s1953666@ed.ac.uk <mailto:s1953666@ed.ac.uk> ) and letâ€™s have a talk.

 

Best wishes, 

Clara
