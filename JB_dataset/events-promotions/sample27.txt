Hi Javi,                    

As you may have heard, the University and Colleges Union (UCU) nationally have called for an additional 14 days of industrial action beginning 24 February. 

After Student Council in November we received a clear mandate from our members to support the Industrial Action being taken in November 2019, including Action Short of a Strike thereafter. Following this we will continue our support of UCU in their upcoming action <https://dmtrk.net/L8C-6QN44-WO2Y99-3YCCW8-1/c.aspx> , though the matter will be considered again in the present context of renewed strike action at our next Student Council on 27 February <https://dmtrk.net/L8C-6QN44-WO2Y99-3YCCW9-1/c.aspx> . In the run up to the Action beginning 24 February we will be having discussions with UCU to determine what this support can look like. 

We feel it is important to recognise that as an organisation that represents all students, there are many Postgraduate Research students who may be taking part in industrial action, in order to improve their working conditions.

We also acknowledge that there will be many students who feel anxious about the impact industrial action may have on them, given it coincides with the end of the teaching period and the lead up to examinations and deadlines. Our priority during this action is to support all students affected by the strike, including making every effort to ensure students feel informed about the potential consequences.  

The Students’ Association will also continue to work with UCU and the University during the strike action to ensure minimal impacts on students’ learning, teaching and wellbeing. We have been assured that all support services including the Disability and Counselling services will remain unpicketed to students. We will also be providing alternative study space in our venues to students who do not wish to cross the picket line.  

We encourage all students to attend Student Council <https://dmtrk.net/L8C-6QN44-WO2Y99-3YCCW9-1/c.aspx>  on 27 February to debate a further motion on supporting the strikes, to ensure that all students' voices are heard in relation to this period of industrial action.
