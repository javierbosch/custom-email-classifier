This is a FREE ticketed event, so make sure to get your tickets early as they will sell out really quickly!

Also, please bring your laptop and USB adaptors to this event as you will need them! :)

Remote Control Car Workshop (Pt 2):

University is draining your pockets? Fear not, for we have the solution! 🌟

In our next workshop, we will teach you how to build your very own metal detector, so you can find all the hidden treasures Edinburgh has to offer! 🐾🔍

This is part 2 of our Remote Control Car Workshop, where we will convert the car we built during the last workshop into a mobile metal detector. But don't worry if you were not able to attend part 1 of this workshop-series, as, although this workshop incorporates what we have done previously, no knowledge from the part-1-workshop is required.

All you need to bring with you is your laptop and your USB adaptor! 💻

See you soon! 😎
