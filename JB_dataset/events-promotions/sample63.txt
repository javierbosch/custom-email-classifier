Part 1: Facebook – Crush Your Code

Come learn how to put your best foot forward at this Technical Interview Workshop by Facebook. The presentation, delivered by Facebook’s Software and Front End Engineers, will cover:
- How to walk through an algorithm problem,
- How to brainstorm solutions,
- How to discuss the problem with your interviewer,
- How to write (and test) code on a whiteboard.

Part 2: Dr. Petros Papapanagiotou – Formal reasoning: from maths to healthcare and beyond

Edinburgh University has over 50 years of history in automated reasoning and theorem proving research, with many breakthrough contributions in these fields. But why do we need formal logic in our lives? How does it link to software development, safety, trust, healthcare, manufacturing, or the Internet of Things? Dr. Papapanagiotou will give an overview of logic-based reasoning, describe methods and techniques, and showcase some of his applied research on correct-by-construction workflow models for smart collaboration.
