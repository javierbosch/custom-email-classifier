[sys-announce] "archlute" reboot on Friday morning
---------------
The server archlute.inf.ed.ac.uk - one of the machines which provides the xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk remote desktop service - will be rebooted at 9:30 on Friday 18 October to clear a problem. The reboot should only take a few minutes. While it's down the other xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk server lute.inf.ed.ac.uk should still be up and operational, so please feel free to use that instead to avoid inconvenience.

There's more about the remote desktop service at:
