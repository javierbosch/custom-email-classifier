[Inf1a-students] Tutorial 6 Update
---------------
Dear Inf1a-students,

 

 

please get the updated version of fp-tutorial6 from Learn or see attached. 

 

This version includes some code needed for QuickCheck to run smoothly at the

end of the file, along with specialised predicates on QuickCheck properties. 

Related conversation on piazza: https://piazza.com/class/jzsdkcmg6uz3hx?cid=576 <https://piazza.com/class/jzsdkcmg6uz3hx?cid=576> . 

Note the indentation on line 359, it should have two spaces before arbitrary. 

 

Best wishes

Irene
