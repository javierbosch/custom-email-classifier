...and here we go from the silence of the previous week... we, your reps, have produced a NEW survey! 


yay.

But this time we are actually VERY SERIOUS about it, because EXAMS ARE COMING (!!!) and we would like to know about how you currently feel about the course and how WE CAN HELP YOU WITH REVISION! We really want to make sure that you guys have everything for productive work and so that you can do your best this semester! So, please, find a few min to finish the survey♡
