Dear Students,

 

As the exam season is coming, InfPALS will be focusing on revision to boost your knowledge and help you do well in Inf1 – Introduction to Computation.

 

This week on  <x-apple-data-detectors://0> Tuesday at 12:10 <x-apple-data-detectors://0> , we’ll be focusing on revision of FSM, DFA and Regex. If you feel behind on these topics, then this session is perfect to help you catch up!

 

See you at the session!

 

All the best,

InfPALS
