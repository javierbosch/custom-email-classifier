Learn How to Build a State of the Art Machine Learning Model in this session. Get to learn about Machine Learning, how it works, how it's being used at Google, and how you can use it now to solve real world problems. We’ll work on a lab exercise (so bring your laptop!). Together we'll see how to train and execute a deep neural network to recognize handwritten digits at better than 99% accuracy.
