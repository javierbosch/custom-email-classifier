Please make sure you have completed all of these before arriving at your session. 	
On Friday 29 November, when you arrive at the psychology building I will give you a short introduction to the study and give you a few short questionnaires. After this, you will be put in one of two interventions for mental health and wellbeing- Therapets or colouring in.You will have 10-minutes in this intervention before filling out two final questionnaires.

Fear not, those of you in the colouring intervention will still get the chance to play with the dogs after you have completed the final surveys :) 	
How long will this take me? 	
This whole study should take you no longer than 30 minutes and is very central in the Psychology building. This will be the perfect de-stressing activities for you to do in your study break!
