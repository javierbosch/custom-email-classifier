[sys-announce] Virtual DICE has been updated
---------------
Hi everyone,

Virtual DICE has been updated slightly. For links and details see the blog post at: 

http://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/systems/2019/10/30/virtual-dice-has-been-updated/

Virtual DICE is like DICE, the School of Informatics computing environment, but it runs in a virtual machine which you can download and run on your own computer.
