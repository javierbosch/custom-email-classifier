[sys-announce] AT server rooms at risk this week
---------------
The electrical testing which has been going on in Appleton Tower for the 
past couple of weeks moves to the basement this week.

In particular, there will be testing carried out on the power supplies to 
the basement server rooms.  This is expected to be non-disruptive, but it 
would be as well to treat the whole of this week as AT RISK.

We suggest you save your work even more freqently than usual this week.
