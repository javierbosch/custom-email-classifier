[ug1-students] Informatics Programming Club starting this Friday
---------------
Dear students,

the Informatics Programming Club is starting with its first session this 
Friday afternoon from 4pm - 6pm in Appleton Tower room 3.09. The club is 
free for everybody to attend and no registration is required.

The idea is to give students some space and resources to work on 
interesting and fun programming projects to improve their skills and 
polish their portfolio. We are also happy to help with any course 
related programming problems you might have.

We have a range of different projects and resources available and plan 
to focus on a few specific ones during different weeks of the semester. 
You can find a schedule on our website where we start with a 
Reinforcement Learning project. You are, however, very welcome to bring 
your own ideas or deviate from the plan.

To take some pressure of the mailing lists, we will send future emails 
about upcoming events via our club mailing list for which you can 
register on our website. We also have a Slack channel if that interests you.

See you on Friday
Volker
