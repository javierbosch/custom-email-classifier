---------------
Hello Everyone, 

The marks for Homework  07 have now been published. Please check and see that your mark is correct if there is a problem please contact me. 

I know that some of you are still not able to view your marks for HW06 we have asked student systems to look at this for us and are just waiting on them getting back to us. 

Thanks

Louise
