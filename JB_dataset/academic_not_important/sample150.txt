Correction to CL2 Q14



A key line was inadvertently lost in our distributed publication process :-)

Questions 13 and 14 should share the following preamble:

We have shown in class that valid syllogisms may be derived from other valid syllogisms using substitution, double negation elimination, and two kinds of contraposition. 

The two forms of contraposition are:

     • Contraposition of the antecedent and succedent in a sequent of the form $$a \vDash \neg b$$, or the same form negated $$a \nvDash \neg b$$ .

      • Contraposition of the conclusion of a rule with either one of its premises.

We have not proved the fact that all valid syllogisms can be derived from Barbara using these two forms of contraposition, but it is a fact.

Most of this is relevant to Q13; the final line, relevant to Q14 was lost in editing.
