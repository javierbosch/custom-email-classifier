[Students] EUSA's Black History Month (October)
---------------
Dear all - some people might be interesting in 
The Edinburgh University Students' Association's Black History Month:
"an opportunity to celebrate and commemorate the individuals and events which have shaped African and Caribbean communities, as well as our collective history."

There's a list of events at:

as well as background information.

Best wishes, Bob
