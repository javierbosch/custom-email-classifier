[ug-students] followup: BME themed student societies
---------------
Dear all:

As a followup to my previous email, I'd like to introduce
some of the EUSA sponsored student societies that relate to
BME themes. This is not a complete list.
The full list of societies is at:
     https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/activities/societies/findasociety/

Generally, these societies are open to postgraduates
as well as undergraduates, and you do not need to have BME
ethnicity to join.

PS: Altogether there are 280 societies (technical, cultural, national,
volunteering, activities, socialising, etc).
There is bound to be something that interests you.


Best wishes, Bob
