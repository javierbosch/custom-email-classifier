[sys-announce] Cloud printing degraded
---------------
The cloud printing issues from yesterday rumble on, but apparently 
intermittently. IS describe the service as "degraded".

It's unclear from the IS status page: https://alerts.is.ed.ac.uk/ if it 
has been degraded for 4 days, or if it is expected to remain degraded for 
4 days.

Their suggestion on:

https://alerts.is.ed.ac.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=view_alert&alert_id=8920

is to just try logging in again.

We will keep the status page on http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk 
updated.
