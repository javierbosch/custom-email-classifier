Dear students

 

Weâ€™d like to alert you to the Huawei UK AI competition 2019, see https://www.drive-ml.com/ .

 

The challenge is to design an autonomous agent that is capable of driving safely and efficiently across a variety of simulated maps containing numerous tasks, such as merging, intersections, high-ways, and many others. They offer such scenarios through a simulator that emulates real-world traffic at a variety of granularity levels.  The

challenges consist of two-phases covering both single and multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios.

 

Competition registration opened on 15 October 2019. The Competition itself commences on 1 November 2019 and ends at midnight on 29th November 2019.
