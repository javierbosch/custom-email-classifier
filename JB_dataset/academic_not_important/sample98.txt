---------------
Dear students,

As part of the Programming Club, we will organise a programming 
competition in week 8 (this week) of the current semester (Friday the 
8th of November, 16:00 - 18:00, AT 5.05).

We had great success last year with many students turning up and 
participating. The competition is partly for you to see how it would be 
like to take part in an actual competition but mostly to have fun There 
will be prizes for the best three teams!

Check out this Informatics news item from last year:

Please turn up on time for the club on the 8th if you want to 
participate. You will start in teams of up to two people, so please use 
the following form to register your team:

If you want to participate but don't have a team mate we can try to find 
one for you on the day or you participate on your own.

All the best
Volker
