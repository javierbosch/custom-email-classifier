Dear all : to celebrate the national diversity of the people
in Informatics, we'll be posting a celebration note as one of
the images on the video screen at the Informatics Forum entrance.

The celebration notes will change each month.

Have we included your country in our list below?
The months listed below are the planned period when your note will
be displayed.

Please note: we are not celebrating the nations themselves
(a controversial topic), but instead our people, who come from
these different regions.

Thanks, Bob
