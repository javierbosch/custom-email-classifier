Hey Javier,

We want to know what you think of the Kaampus website!  

Kaampus <https://gradtouch.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9bf9749d7f565562f71737b7b&id=1cb28fa978&e=3eb7edb692>  is a platform connecting university societies with sponsorship from top graduate employers across the UK and abroad.

They're still fairly new, and are always looking for ways to improve their offering for students like you, so they would like your feedback to help them do exactly that.
 
In return, they’re offering a tasty £50 gift card to spend at Nando’s for one lucky survey participant! Double your chances of winning by also creating and activating a Kaampus account for your society.* 🍗
 
Before you complete the survey, please take a few minutes to have a look over the Kaampus website here <https://gradtouch.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9bf9749d7f565562f71737b7b&id=5d775205d1&e=3eb7edb692>  and then click below to go to the survey <https://gradtouch.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9bf9749d7f565562f71737b7b&id=b3411e713a&e=3eb7edb692> .
 
Good luck!

*All survey participants will be entered into the prize draw for the £50 Nando's gift card.
