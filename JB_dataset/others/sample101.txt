Welcome to Informatics!

In addition to your University EASE account, we have set up an
Informatics DICE account for you so that you will be able to access
locally provided services within Informatics. You will need your
Informatics DICE username, for example, to access the machines in the
Informatics student labs. Before you can use your Informatics DICE
account, you need to set up a password. You can do this by going to
'http://pp.inf.ed.ac.uk' and following the instructions you will find
there. If you have any problems, simply reply to this message with a
description of the problems you have encountered.

For more information on your DICE account, please see:
