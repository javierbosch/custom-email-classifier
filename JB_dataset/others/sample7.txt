Dear Residents 
  
Withdrawal of cleaning service provision  
  
  
You will be aware that the University has been closely monitoring the Coronavirus (Covd-19) outbreak and have been communicating with all students on this matter.  
   
As recently advised, to comply with the UK and Scottish Government directives, all cleaning services have been withdrawn.  This will protect staff and residents alike by reducing the risks of person to person virus transfer.   
   
Until we are able to resume our assistance with your cleaning, it is essential that residents maintain the highest possible hygiene standards and keep communal areas, en-suites, shared bathrooms and bedrooms clean.  It is now your responsibility to ensure you are cleaning these areas frequently to limit any risks of catching or spreading the virus.  Please ensure rubbish and recycling are taken to communal bin stores regularly. Please ensure you are cleaning all areas you are in contact with, including worktops, dining tables, cookers, fridges and other appliances before and after every use. 
  
Please continue to report repairs in the usual way, however, please be aware that our trades team will only attend to life-critical repairs at this time.   
  
There is support in place in our accommodation if you are self-isolating because you have symptoms or as a result of living with someone with symptoms. If this is the situation you are in, please contact Community Support on <mailto:Security24-7@ed.ac.uk> Security24-7@ed.ac.uk to let them know that you are self-isolating and they will provide further guidance  on the welfare support available.   
  
You can also find lots of helpful information and frequently asked questions (FAQs) being regularly update on the Health & Safety website here:
