Meters Access
---------------
Dear Riego Residents,  
  
Please be informed that tomorrow I will require access to all flats to check all electrical meters. Access will only be to the cupboards where the meters are, and just for a few minutes. No disruption or inconvenience is anticipated. Visits to flats will start at approx. 11am. 
  
Thank you 
  
Kind regards
