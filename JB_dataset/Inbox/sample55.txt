Proofs and Problem Solving (2019-2020)[SEM2]: PPS Week 11
---------------
Hi everyone,

A couple of reminders:

*	Homework 8 is due by the end today through Turnitin, follow the same guidance as last week. Homework 9 will be due next Monday (Apr 6), and Homework 10 the Friday of that week (Apr 10).
*	(Some have noted they don't see their Homework 6 grades; these have yet to be posted, so hang tight.)
*	Reading test 10 (the final reading test) is due tomorrow (Mar 31) by the end of the day.
*	Lectures for Week 11 (the final set of lectures) will be released Tomorrow/Tuesday evening at 23:59pm.

Grading: Many of you have asked on Piazza and through email about how final marks will be determined. The School is still deciding on how this will work for first year classes, so unfortunately I don't have any new information for you yet, nor do I have a timeline. I know this can be frustrating, but the School is thinking very carefully about how this will work across all courses. Once I receive more information, I will let you all know how your grades will be determined. Until then, please keep doing the homeworks and reading tests.

Best,

Jonas
