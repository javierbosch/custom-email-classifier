Hi all,

we are aware that the feedback framework is difficult to access. We are looking into that.

I will definitely give you guys an extension of the deadline, I just need to figure out for how long because it might affect the tutorial sessions next week and could cross over with the third part of the assignment. It will like be at least until Monday, potentially more.

I will make a decision later today and let you know.

Cheers

Volker
