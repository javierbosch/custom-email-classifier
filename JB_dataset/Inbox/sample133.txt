Re: [sys-announce] Informatics Server Area - Cooling Failure
---------------
Dear all,

The cooling has now been re-instated. This is only a temporary solution
- the problem was caused by a failed circuit board which still needs to
be replaced. Until this has happened you should continue to consider all
services to be at risk of being shut down at short notice.

All the servers that were powered down are now carefully being turned
back on and full service should be resumed in due course.
