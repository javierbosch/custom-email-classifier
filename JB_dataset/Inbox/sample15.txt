[sys-announce] Informatics core network switch reboot on Thursday	morning
---------------
We have one remaining Informatics core network switch to reboot.  This is 
the last in the sequence which we started some time ago, but was held up by 
the strike action and then the lockdown.

Subject to final sign-off, we intend doing this on Thursday morning.  
Unfortunately we can't be more specific about the time, as it depends on 
whether there are any delays gaining physical access to Appleton Tower.

This is the core switch which normally connects Informatics to the rest of
the EdLAN network.  The reboot will therefore cause a short period of
disruption to users of Informatics resources.  We expect this to take the
form of one or two breaks of a few seconds each as traffic fails over to use
our backup link.

We normally do these reboots out of hours if we can.  Unfortunately, Aruba 
advise that there is a chance that manual intervention might be required 
(though it wasn't for any of the orther half-dozen core switches we'e done) 
and so we have to be on-site for the work to minimise the effect in the 
unlikely event that it doesn't just go through smoothly.

The reboot is required to bring new firmware into use, but mainly because the 
switch's internal clock counts in centiseconds and will wrap in May after 
497 days uptime.  The idea is to schedule it now while we're fit.
