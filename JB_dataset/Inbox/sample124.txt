What is Yearbook?
It is a published book annually containing photographs and other 
information of current and graduating students from your university.
It is a nice memory book of your university years. 
You can share it with your parents, grandparents friends and other relatives.

Your Yearbook profile page is built from your response to registration questions. 
Apart from your contact details each submitted entry and profile photo will be 
published and designed in the Yearbook.
