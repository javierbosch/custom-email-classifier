[Students] Coursework submission
---------------
Hi all,

 

Just to make it clear as I appear to not have in my last email. If you have submitted course work that is hand written today, do not worry-we are working on a contingency. We DO NOT expect you to re-write submissions so please, no one panic. 

 

Any submissions from today onwards until further notice should be handed in to the forum 2.33.

 

Kind regards,

 

Jade

 

Ps please do not hesitate to get in touch with me directly if you have any queries
