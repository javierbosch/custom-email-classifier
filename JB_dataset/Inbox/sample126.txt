[Students] My apologies - International Women’s Day Celebration is NOT on a strike day!
---------------
Hello everyone,  

first of all, I have to apologise to Hoppers and everyone who is organising the event for not realising that the event is on a Saturday. 

Saturday is obviously NOT a strike day - it’s not a work day. Thank you to the two alert staff members who caught the original error, and then suggested that I send an apology to students@inf as well as staff@inf, to make sure everyone is covered, and to the student who explained why this event matters so much to Hoppers. 

The email to staff was quick; the email students is coming later, because it’s taken me a bit longer to write and I wanted to be sure I had the correct mailing list. 

I hope you all have a great time networking on Saturday!

Maria
