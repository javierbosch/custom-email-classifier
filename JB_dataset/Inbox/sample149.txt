[Students] Appleton Tower occupation
---------------
Dear students
 
Further to my email of earlier today, I can now confirm that you can access the Appleton Tower for independent study and research.  This will be kept under review as we may require to close the building in the future if the situation changes. In the meantime, the University will ensure there are regular checks so that there are adequate health and safety measures in place to protect your safety when you are in the building. However we remind you to please treat any alarm activations seriously and evacuate immediately â€“ as you would normally - using the fire exit stairs and do not use the lifts. 
 
Staff are still not able to access Appleton Tower except to maintain equipment essential to support your studies. As indicated in my previous message, theInformatics Teaching Office has been relocated to Informatics Forum Room 2.33; and Student Support Coordinators have been relocated to Informatics Forum Room 2.46. If you need to contact them, they can be contacted on their usual email or by visiting the Informatics Forum. Your student card will be updated to permit you access to the Informatics Forum while the Teaching Office and Student Support Coordinators are located in the Forum.
 
We apologise for inconvenience caused.  The University will continue to keep you updated about industrial action at https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/heaction <https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/heaction> .
 
With best wishes,
Jane
