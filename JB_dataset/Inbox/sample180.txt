We will be contacting some of the local universities and their societies, feel free to share the news with any people that may be interested or/and any university contacts you have :)

What is Amazon Early Insights?

The students will hear from experts that work on projects that benefit Amazon customers around the world with the eventual aim of participating in a two-day hackathon.
This year, Amazon Early Insights will be held in two locations, Edinburgh(15-17th April) & London (7-9th April)! Please see here for more information & application forms: https://amazondc.com/early-insights . Applications for 2020 are open until Sunday 15th March.
