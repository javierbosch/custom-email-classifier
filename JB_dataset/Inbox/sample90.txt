[Students] Appleton Tower - out of hours entrance change from 24th	March
---------------
The 'out of hours' entrance for Appleton Tower is expected to change from being the main front door to the side entrance (at the right hand side of the revolving door as you come in), as of the evening of Tuesday 24th Mar.  i.e. if the main door doesn't work for you and the revolving door is locked, try the side door.

 

This change has come about to try to limit the amount of time these doors are open (and visible) to tailgaters.

 

There will be CCTV covering the new entrance. Signage, regarding direction to the door, will go up on the 24th Mar.
