Dear All,


I know this is a stressful time and the future seems quite uncertain.  I hope you are all now safely established where you can continue your studies remotely.  The School will do all it can to support you in this new mode of working and we understand that this adaptation will take time.  For some of you there will be issues you need our help to resolve so, if this is the case, please don’t hesitate to contact your Personal Tutor and the Informatics Student Support Team on inf-sst@inf.ed.ac.uk <mailto:inf-sst@inf.ed.ac.uk> .


Many of you have been asking about arrangements for the upcoming examination diet.  In College of Science and Engineering the three “quantitative schools” (Physics & Astronomy, Mathematics and Informatics) have agreed a framework across the Schools that is consistent with University guidance.  This email will provide you with more detail on examination arrangements.


In the design of the framework we have taken account of:

*	The highly disruptive and stressful circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic.  This means that unlike a normal examination diet, there are huge differences in circumstances (equipment, network access, degree of control due to covid-19 in your country, …).
*	Your responses to the situation which will differ significantly depending on your personality and circumstances.

Given these considerations, we have attempted to design an approach that is adaptable to a wide range of material and personal circumstances and provides a flexible approach to assessment that is based on your performance across your programme.

*	As the Principal announced, there will be NO non-honours examination diet:

	*	The examination board will consider your performance over your programme and in the light of this will award PASS/FAIL grades for courses where the examinations are a significant part of the course assessment.  Courses assessed predominantly by coursework will award a mark and grade for the course.
	*	Students awarded FAIL grades by the examination board will have the opportunity to take an online assessment later in the summer.  Satisfactory performance in these assessments will result in the award of a PASS grade for the course.
	*	For students expecting to take a resit of a first- or second-year examination will be considered in the same way as students taking the course for the first time.  Their overall performance and most recent coursework for the course will be considered in deciding the award of a PASS/FAIL grade.

*	It is very important that finish your coursework as best you can.  This will ensure that you have understood the material that you’ve been studying.  We realise that the move to remote teaching has been disruptive.  This is why we have extended deadlines to take account of disruption.
*	Finally, I want to remind you all that we will move to remote teaching from Monday.  Please check your courses’ LEARN pages to see what is happening. There will surely be some teething problems, both at the University end and wherever you might be, but we’ll resolve these as quickly and as best we can.



I hope this provides you with some certainty of what lies ahead in the examination diet.  Inevitably there will be follow up questions.  Please send them to me and I’ll gather them together and develop an FAQ for the examination.


Best regards


Stuart
Director of Learning and Teaching
