Research talk: 

Computational Social Science: studying social complexity in 21st century

As a researcher trained in complex systems physics, my main fascination is with “emergent phenomena”, that is, systems which can be observed to have properties that their component parts do not have on their own. Social phenomena are a prominent demonstration of emergence, which we can observe in the behaviour of individuals in groups and organisations. Emergent phenomena are often unpredictable and hard to understand due to the intrinsic complexity that they demonstrate. However, with the advancement in our computational tools and availability of large-scale transactional data (aka “big data”), the new field of computational social science has been forming. In this new field, social phenomena are studied using a similar framework to the natural sciences that is, observation, quantification, modelling, and experimentation, driven by social theory and facilitated by large-scale social data collection and analysis. In this talk I will showcase few examples of research in computational social science.

 

9.45am: Bjorn Ross (host Kami Vaniea)

 

Biography:

Björn Ross is a researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Cognitive Science of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. In his PhD thesis, he focused on the diffusion of information, emotions and opinions on social media. Since 2018 he has led a research team on Social Data Science. His core interest is in applying computer science methods from agent-based modelling, natural language processing and graph analysis to study social media in a wider sense. A key focus of Björn’s research is to explore negative aspects of social media, such as social bots, misinformation, and hate speech. His articles have been published in international peer-reviewed journals including the European Journal of Information Systems and Information, Communication & Society, and his work has been presented at conferences such as ICIS and ICWSM.

Research talk: 

Social Media in the Era of Disinformation: How Social Bots Could Manipulate the Process of Political Opinion Formation

After giving a broad overview of his research into the spread of information and opinions on social media, Björn will present the results of an interdisciplinary research effort that studied how manipulative actors could influence the formation of political opinions on social media. This work draws on the spiral of silence theory from social psychology and public opinion research. Using agent-based modeling, it is possible to examine the conditions in which bots and similar actors can effectively influence public opinion.

 

10.30am: Daniel Archambault (host Benjamin Bach) 

 

Biography:

Daniel Archambault creates visualisations and visual analytics systems that scale in the age of data science.  He is a world leading expert in designing information visualisation, in particular in the area of graph drawing and network visualisation, and evaluating such techniques for perceptual effectiveness.  Central to his work is how visualisation and network analytics can interact to produce effective systems for data analysis.  His work on scalable network visualisation and analysis and dynamic network visualisation has had an impact on the computational social sciences through how it interacts with graph mining for social network analysis (e.g. community finding and graph sampling).  Over his career, he has collaborated with many disciplines including but not limited to biologists, social scientists, and humanities scholars.  He has lectured and published extensively in these areas and has served on most of the major conference organising committees, including AAAI ICWSM (Senior IPC), IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and Graph Drawing & Network Visualisation.  He received his PhD from the University of British Columbia in Canada in 2008.  After post-doctoral studies in France and Ireland, he became a Senior Lecturer at Swansea University.

Research talk: 

Network Analysis and Visualisation in the Computational Social Sciences

 

Central to the challenge of computational social science are networks.  Social networks model the relationships between individuals and can solve interesting problems in the humanities, social sciences, and public health.  In the era of data science, not only are scalable analytics techniques of networks required, but we must develop new visualisation techniques and test their effectiveness with human users for the purposes of explanation and discovery.  Such experts will need to work at the intersection of machine learning and graph mining, network visualisation and analysis, human-centred methods, and computational social science.  In this research talk, I will present my experience in network analytics, network visualisation, and computational social science to develop efficient analytics techniques that are effective with humans.  Topics will include mining and visualising online blog networks to discover trends in English language usage in Ireland, validating community finding approaches for network analysis from a human-centred perspective, the perceptual effects of graph sampling, and techniques to analyse dynamic graphs for public health applications.

Research talk: 

Copy Content, Copy Friends: Modelling the Content Curation and Social Bootstrapping

 

Copying, sharing and linking have always been important for the functioning and the growth of the World Wide Web. Two recent copying trends which have emerged are social content curation and social logins. Social curation involves the copying, categorization and sharing of links and images from third party websites on the social curation website. Social logins enable the copying of user identities and their friends from an established social network such as Facebook or Twitter, onto third party websites. 

 

In this talk, I will chronicle my ongoing work on Pinterest, a popular image sharing website and social network. The highly active user community on Pinterest has been instrumental in making social curation a mainstream phenomenon. Interestingly, a large fraction (nearly 60%) of the users have also linked their Pinterest accounts with Facebook and have copied their Facebook friends over onto the new website. Thus, using a large dataset from Pinterest, we uncover both the practices used for sharing content, as well as how the copying of friends has helped the content sharing.

Research talk: 

Biased and inaccurate information on social networks

There has been a great deal of concern about the negative impacts of social media on democracy and society. In this talk, I explore two ways in which social networks can negatively affect public discourse. First, I will briefly discuss a set of large social network experiments in which n = 2,520 human subjects play a voter game. These experiments demonstrate how players’ voting decisions can be heavily biased by the structure of the polling network via a phenomenon we call “information gerrymandering”. Next, I will discuss studies examining the spread of misinformation on Twitter. I begin by describing a hybrid lab-field study with almost 2000 Twitter users that demonstrates that people who rely on intuitive gut responses over analytical thinking share more low-quality news. I then build on this observation with a Twitter field experiment that uses a subtle intervention to nudge people to think about accuracy.  We messaged over 5000 Twitter users who had previously shared links to misinformation sites, and asked them to rate the accuracy of a single non-political headline - therefore making the concept of accuracy more top-of-mind for them. The message significantly improved the quality of the news sources they shared subsequently. Our experimental design translates directly into an intervention that social media companies could deploy to fight misinformation online. Finally, I will briefly describe theoretical work exploring how network structure effects the emergence of intuitive versus deliberating thinking. Together, these projects provide an integrative view of informative dynamics on networks.

 

1.15pm: Onur Varol (host Walid Magdy)

 

Biography:

Onur Varol is a postdoctoral research associate at Northeastern University at the Center for Complex Network Research. He completed his PhD in Informatics at Indiana University, Bloomington (USA).

Research talk: 

Modeling individual and group behavior in complex interactive systems

 

The unprecedented increase in social media use and the large-scale collection of information poses new threats as well as bringing new opportunities. Modeling and managing complex interactive systems require mining of social and technological signals for new insights into human society and individual behavior. Online social networks have been taking an essential part in our access to information and it acts as a good proxy for studying population-level behavioral patterns and making individual-level predictions. In this talk, I will be presenting my research on analyzing various account behaviors from social bots disseminating misinformation to human venting their emotions to their friends. First, I will present Botometer, a platform for detecting social bots, that is widely adopted in academia and industry to study the dissemination of misinformation and characterization of automated behavior. Using estimations by Botometer, I will show how bot activities have effects on information spread, and I will demonstrate our results on estimating the prevalence of social bots and anomalous patterns captured among popular accounts investigated. Later I will demonstrate how we can leverage social media to study the evolution of human emotions in a minute-scale resolution at the population scale. I will conclude my talk by presenting results on the ego-centric analysis of individual well-being through analyzing sleep and online self-reports and explain how these projects are instrumental for my research agenda to model interactions between well-being, online and offline activities, and various biological information.

 

2.00pm: Feedback session

 

 

Teaching talks

The presentation should be a 20 minute lecture aimed at second year undergraduates in Informatics as part of an introductory machine learning or data science course. The lecture should introduce PCA as a method for dimensionality reduction and visualisation, using an example from social science. You can assume that the audience is familiar with linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics (including probability) and computer science concepts at the first year undergraduate level. The presentation will be attended by students and staff and there will be five minutes afterwards to ask questions about the presentation, and about the candidate's approach to teaching.
