Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Week 6 Homework
---------------
Dear students,

You will have seen that the occupation of Appleton Tower has been lifted. Therefore, tomorrow's Workshops will go ahead as scheduled. You are hence expected to attend, and to hand in your Week 6 Homework to your tutor, as usual. If you are unable to attend, or if you are uncomfortable with crossing picket lines, you may hand in electronically to your tutor or through Turnitin; as last week, we have created a link for submission on the course Learn page, under the tab "Assessments". I have extended the deadline for electronic submission to 21:00 pm tomorrow, Tuesday March 3.

Best,

Nikola
