Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Week 10 Worksheet
---------------
Dear students,

I hope that you are keeping well and staying safe, wherever you may be.

I wanted to remind you that the Week 10 Worksheet is now available for self-study; I would encourage you to attempt the Worksheet in your own time, provided you are in a position to do so. Likewise, I would encourage you to ask any questions you may have on the Worksheet through Piazza; your Workshop tutors will be happy to answer them.

Best,

Nikola
