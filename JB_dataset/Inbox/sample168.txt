Informatics 1 - Object Oriented Programming (2019-2020)[SEM2]: First Assignment AutoTest feedback now visible on CodeGrade
---------------
Hi all,

I just learned during the tutorial that the results of the advanced auto tests are hidden from you on CodeGrade. Apologies about that. I have made them available for you now and am currently rerunning the testing for all submissions. You should be able to view your auto test results directly on CodeGrade in a few minutes, including the advanced tests.

See here (where the mouse pointer is):






Also, I fixed a minor mistake in the Advanced test FoxHoundIOAdvancedTest where I used a file data01.txt instead of game01.txt. I ran all submissions again and updated the sample solutions.

Cheers

Volker
