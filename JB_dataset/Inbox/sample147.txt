[Inf1a-students] Participants needed for a usability study of an interactive tool for learning syllogisms
---------------
Dear Inf1a students,

(This study was certified according to the Informatics Research Ethics Process, RT number 24897.)

My name is Raees and I am a UG4 student studying Computer Science. As part of my honours project, I am building an interactive tool to help students learn syllogisms. 

In an effort to find usability problems with the tool, I would like some students to complete a series of tasks with the tool. Attached is a participant information sheet if you would like to learn more about the study.

The study will take approximately 30 minutes and you will be awarded a Â£10 Amazon voucher for your time. If you would like to participate in the study, please reply to this email and I will get in touch to arrange a time that is suitable for you.

Kind regards,

Raees.
