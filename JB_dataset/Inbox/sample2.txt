Careers Service Remains Open - Virtually!
---------------
Dear Javi,

I hope you are all well and are managing in these strange times. I thought i would just email to let you know that the Careers Service remains open (virtually) and I'm here to help in whatever way i can,

FIRSTLY

As i said in the email heading the Careers Service (and me!) remain open virtually to answer any of your careers related enquiries - appointments can still be booked via MS Teams or Skype. We are still adding some vacancies to MyCareerHub - mostly of the virtual/remote working kind.

I have also set up an online drop in session next week - Monday 27 April 11-12 (link below). Feel free to drop in at any time to ask any questions you might have

SECONDLY

We have found about an organisation offering FREE online work experience. Not paid but giving you the experience of working on a number of hypothetical but realistic projects set by some top companies. You may have heard of it because we think over 550 University of Edinburgh students have already enrolled.
www.insidesherpa.com <http://www.insidesherpa.com/> .

See attached for some notes shared by a colleague who attended a webinar about this FREE programme.

These are mostly business related projects but some are around data analysis and anyway could be useful in developing some some useful skills
