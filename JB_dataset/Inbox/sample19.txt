[Students] Tomorrow: Tues 14th. Machine Learning Interview Talks
---------------
Dear Informatics staff and students

We are just about to start the machine learning interview talks:

_Tuesday 14th April from 10:30am sharp.

We invite staff and students to attend this. Please note all talks are 
confidential and should not be shared outwith the school.

You may attend the talks by following the link

Please come in a couple of minutes ahead of time to ensure you are set 
up and that you do not interrupt the candidate inadvertently.

You will need to agree for your browser to use your microphone and 
video. However, all attendees are asked to make sure to mute their 
microphones when they enter the session, and to have video off too, 
outside the question time. Given the difficulties of the online format, 
we will need to leave questions to the end of the talks. We will provide 
instructions for asking questions at that point.

The talks are at...

Research talks:

10.30am Yingzhen Li: Deep probabilistic modelling for reliable machine 
learning systems
11.15am Yongxin Yang: Neural Networks for Option Pricing: Rationality by 
Design

Teaching talks (on Convolutional Networks)

2.45pm Yongxin Yang
3.15pm Break
3.30pm Yingzhen Li

Abstracts, bios and further details are in the attachment.

Feedback on the talks can be sent by email to Jane Hillston 
(Jane.Hillston@ed.ac.uk) or Amos Storkey (A.Storkey@ed.ac.uk)

regards

Amos Storkey
