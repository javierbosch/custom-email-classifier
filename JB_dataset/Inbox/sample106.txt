Re: [Students] [Staff] International Women's Day
---------------

Yes, very nice that there is some progress. 
But .. you don't mention the 16.6% pay gap ?  Has this actually decreased much over the years?
Since it is international women's day, can I ask what is the pay gap in Informatics?
I think that's probably also a percentage we need to work on in the future :)

Best wishes

	Hi - You have probably heard that today is International Women's Day.
	
	Something to think about is that women are 50% of the population.
	On the other hand, only about 30% of Informatics students are female, 
	and 15% of academic staff. Why this is, is a complicated question.
	
	And the percentages are increasing. When I came as a PhD student, it was
	only about 10% of students and 0% of academic staff. And we now
	have had two women as Heads of School.
	
	Let's keep on working for better percentages in the future.
	
	Best wishes to everybody, Bob
