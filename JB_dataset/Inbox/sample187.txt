Proofs and Problem Solving (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Mid-Semester Feedback for PPS
---------------
Hi everyone,

Firstly, remember that this coming week there are no classes and workshops. The next workshop is February 24th (when Homework 4 is due) and the current reading test is not due until the 25th.

Secondly, we would like to collect mid-semester feedback from you all about the course. At the bottom of the Learn page, you will find two surveys, one for feedback on the lectures and one for feedback on the workshops. The surveys will be available until February 21st. While they aren't mandatory, your input is valuable to us and helps us improve the course.

Best,

Jonas
