[Students] Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers	webinar
---------------
Dear students -

The UK has a professional association that supports Black and
Minority Ethnic Engineers:

    https://afbe.org.uk/

AFBE-UK (Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers) promotes
higher achievements in education and engineering particularly among
people from black and minority ethnicity (BME) backgrounds.
This may interest some students.

Of possible broader interest is a webinar next week:


    The 5Gs of Radio: Debunking the Myths:
    https://afbe.org.uk/events/the-5gs-of-radio-debunking-the-myths

Abstract: A new mobile network technology generation (5G) has triggered a series of alarming claims, demonstrations and even violence about connected health threats.
The same phenomenon happened in the 1990s and 2000s. The existence of social networks, and public opinion against the fear of mobile phone towers is rife because these towers are visible landmarks of the technology.
Dr Nike Folayan will explain the different generations of Radio and attempt to burst myths surrounding EM waves especially as it relates to the use and applications of these technologies.


Best wishes, Bob
