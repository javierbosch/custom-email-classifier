How're You Doing?
---------------
Hey,

This is just a short email from your RA just to check in on how you’re all doing. 

The sun is back and the weather is almost warmish! Well done for surviving the Edinburgh winter. 

We’re well past the middle of the semester now, not that it feels like it; the strikes have affected pretty much all of us and the disruption to our studies can be stressful and frustrating. Moreover, not having a regular schedule can be a little disorientating too. All my classes have been called off, and I’ve had deadlines shifted around too. 

I therefore just want to reach out and ask how you’re coping with all of this, and if there is anything we, as RA’s, can do for you. If you want more group study events, park runs, movie nights, anything you think helps give you a bit more structure or is a change from the mundane, please let me know. It would be great to hear from you. 

As for events coming up, we have:

Harry Potter movie night on the 13th
Ice skating on the 18th
Pub quiz at Teviot on the 22nd
Gardening on the meadows every Saturday
street cleanup (tbc)
Whisky tasting on the 27th
Earth hour on Salisbury crags 28th

Please come along if any those interest you. If there is anything you’d like to do, then don’t hesitate to make suggestions.

Hope things are going well.

Best wishes,
Your RA Andrew
