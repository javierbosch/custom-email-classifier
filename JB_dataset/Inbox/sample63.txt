[ug1-students] InfPALS Leader Application Deadline Today
---------------
Dear Students,

 

Given the current situation surrounding the Covid-19, all of us at InfPALS have been affected by these uncertain times in one way or the other, so we know that an application to be an InfPALS Leader next year is not likely to be a priority on anyoneâ€™s mind right now. However, if you are passionate about supporting new Informatics students in their transition into University, it should take no longer than 10 minutes to fill out our application form:

 

https://forms.gle/kNwgcr4SJZuEoTmB9 <https://forms.gle/kNwgcr4SJZuEoTmB9> 

 

Note that the deadline for applying is today midnight at 12:00AM after which the application will be closed. 

 

We want to thank anyone who has and will apply, InfPALS could not exist without the students of Informatics and we are grateful for anyone willing to invest their time to strengthen the education that this University delivers! Please stay safe!

 

Sincerely,

InfPALS
