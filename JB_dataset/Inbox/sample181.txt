[Students] Opportunity to join a sustainable fintech startup
---------------
Reducing your personal carbon emissions is the easiest way for an individual to fight climate change. That's why NetZero is aiming to make tracking your carbon footprint easier than it's ever been.

 

We are developing a fintech app that connects to your bank accounts as well as a Green Credit Card to go with it. Our users will be able to track their carbon footprint analytics, access sustainable shopping deals and rewards as well as automatically offset their monthly emissions. 

 

Currently three co-founders working part-time and based in Edinburgh, we are looking for students with a passion for sustainability and building practical solutions to join our team. If this interests you, find out more at http://bit.ly/JoinNetZeroor email us at team@netzero.world <mailto:team@netzero.world>
