Proofs and Problem Solving (2019-2020)[SEM2]: New Homework 10 deadline
---------------
Dear all,

University staff will now get the 10th and 13th of April off, and so MTO will not be able to offer online support on those days. Because of this, I am changing the deadline for Homework 10 (originally due April 10th), it is now due April 14th. You still have the option to turn it in earlier online if you choose. If any of you have any authorized extensions, they now start from 14th.

Homework 9 has not changed and is still due Monday.

Both these assignments still have the same hand-in procedure: submit through Turnitin through the links on Learn; if Turnitin gives you an error and you are not able to submit through the link, then email your tutor and Louise Durie (l.durie@ed.ac.uk) in the same email with your assignment.

Best,

Jonas
