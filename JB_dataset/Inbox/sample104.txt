Re: [Students] [Staff] International Women's Day

sorry Valentine had actually cc-ed all the students which is why I replied to the same list. I wouldn't have done so otherwise.
It seems that you've had had my message but not Valentine's (yet). Apologies for the confusion. 

Best wishes
Peggy

	Subject: Re: [Students] [Staff] International Women's Day 
	 
	Dear Valentine, 

	I was not trying to prove any point, especially to the students and I am sorry if it sounded offensive (did it?).

	I recently became aware of the 16.6% pay gap number and articles such as this one 
	https://studentnewspaper.org/staff-inequalities-at-the-university-of-edinburgh-must-be-tackled/
	and - on international womens' day - was surprised that this was not what was being discussed, the existing challenges and gaps, the issues more than the successes... as something to improve on even if it were to clarify, invalidate or justify those numbers about pay gap.  

	I think there has been progress but there's a long way to go still.  

	It might actually be the case that the pay gap has decreased substantially over the period Bob describes, I don't know (I'd love to hear if that's the case) and it was a genuine question. 

	I am fully aware that this means women don't progress as much, especially to the higher academic ranks.
	Whether it is the choice of the women not to do so (as you seem to suggest), or whether it is a bit more complicated than that, is the question. 

	Best wishes,
	Peggy

		Hi Peggy,

		
		

		Since you so kindly CC’d the entire student body I feel compelled to participate in the conversation.

		
		

		I’m sure you have seen the University’s Equal Pay Reports which report that the average gender pay gap for each University Grade (UE01 – UE10) is generally less than 5%. In fact, half of the Grades have a pay gap of less than 1%.

		
		

		If you don’t factorise the University Grade (how senior and demanding the position is) then yes, the overall salary pay gap is 16.6%. This isn’t any different from comparing the salaries of Senior Researchers against Tutors, despite there being an insignificant pay gap (as defined by The Equality and Human Rights Commission) inside those positions.

		
		

		So why the Gender Pay Gap? Because more than twice as many men choose to work in the UE10 Grade (more stressful position, but also much higher pay). The only way to reduce this ‘overall’ gender pay gap is by inviting more women to work in the higher UE Grades. As Professor Fisher has described, this is exactly the School’s strategy: recruiting more female academic staff and nominating two highly successful women as their Heads of School.

		
		

		I understand the eagerness to prove a point in front of the whole student body, but I would instead like to show respect and gratitude for the effort that the School is doing to improve its social responsibility.

		
		

		Best wishes,

		Valentine

		Yes, very nice that there is some progress. 
		But .. you don't mention the 16.6% pay gap ?  Has this actually decreased much over the years?
		Since it is international women's day, can I ask what is the pay gap in Informatics?
		I think that's probably also a percentage we need to work on in the future :)

		Best wishes
		Peggy

			Hi - You have probably heard that today is International Women's Day.
			
			Something to think about is that women are 50% of the population.
			On the other hand, only about 30% of Informatics students are female, 
			and 15% of academic staff. Why this is, is a complicated question.

			Let's keep on working for better percentages in the future.
