[Students] International Women's Day
---------------
Hi - You have probably heard that today is International Women's Day.

Something to think about is that women are 50% of the population.
On the other hand, only about 30% of Informatics students are female, 
and 15% of academic staff. Why this is, is a complicated question.

And the percentages are increasing. When I came as a PhD student, it was
only about 10% of students and 0% of academic staff. And we now
have had two women as Heads of School.

Let's keep on working for better percentages in the future.

Best wishes to everybody, Bob
Equality & Diversity
