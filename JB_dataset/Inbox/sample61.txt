Re: [ug1-students] Examination arrangements in School of Informatics

Dear All,
Thank you for all your questions.  Some of them have raised issues that need resolution across the Schools in the University to ensure consistency of approach.  This is not a rapid process since it involves coordinating the views of 22 Schools.  Once these issues have been resolved we will issue a revised implementation plan for V-P Harmon’s framework for the examinations.  Our implementation plan may undergo some significant revisions and we will attempt to clarify points that have been raised in your questions.  So, meantime, please don’t send additional questions because it may be that the revised implementation plan addresses your concerns.


Thank you for your patience,


Stuart.
