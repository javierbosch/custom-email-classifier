[Students] Course work submissions to Appleton Tower
---------------
Dear students,

 

Due to Appleton tower being occupied, could any student that has already submitted course work to the course work submission box on level 6, please re-print the piece of work and hand it into room 2.33 in the Forum, where the ITO team is temporarily situated. 

 

Kind regards,

 

Jade
