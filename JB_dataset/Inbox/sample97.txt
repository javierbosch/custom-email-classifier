Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Week 7 Homework
---------------
Dear students,

As the Industrial Action is continuing, you may hand in your Week 7 Homework electronically to your tutor or through Turnitin; as last week, we have created a link for submission on the course Learn page, under the tab "Assessments". I have extended the deadline for electronic submission to 21:00 pm today, Tuesday March 10.

Best,

Nikola
