[sys-announce] Forum network disruption on Monday lunch-time
---------------
As part of the preparatory work for the EdLAN replacement project, we need 
to re-patch some of the network servers in the Forum.  This will be mostly 
transparent, but there are a few cases where you might notice a couple of 
minutes or so of network disruption.  In particular, the Forum OpenVPN 
endpoint will be inaccessible at some point, and it may take a few seconds 
for routing to readjust as we do the main "external" router.

We propose starting at 13:00 on Monday, but can't give exact times for each 
individual outage as we'll just have to take each patch-lead as it comes in 
the cable bundle.

There will necesasrily be more disruption ahead as the EdLAN replacement 
project progresses.  We'll announce these nearer the time.
