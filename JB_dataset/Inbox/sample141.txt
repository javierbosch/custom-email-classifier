Hello everyone! (Apologies for cross-posting)

 

 

Thank you very much to all of you who have already completed the online survey, and for all the helpful feedback. If you havenâ€™t responded yet, I would be very grateful if you took 5-10 minutes to give it a go! 

 

Just a reminder, the survey aim is to find out more about people's current password management habits, while at the same time gathering opinions on a graphical authentication scheme. It is part of my research for my fourth year Honours project.

 

The online survey is accessible at the link below:
