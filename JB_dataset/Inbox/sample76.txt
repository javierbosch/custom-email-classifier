[sys-announce] remote desktop service
---------------
Dear all,

Now that we're all working remotely, the remote desktop servers are struggling under the load.
Last night we had to reboot one which had become unusable, and we may have to terminate disruptive processes. 
You can help!

* Taught students, please do your coursework on your lab.inf.ed.ac.uk <http://lab.inf.ed.ac.uk>  computer.
  (For details see http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/remote-lab)

* Everyone please use the new remote.inf.ed.ac.uk <http://remote.inf.ed.ac.uk>  desktop servers, instead of xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk <http://xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk>  and staff.xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk.
  (For details see the COVID-19 sections of http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/remote-desktop)

* If you can, please logout of your session when you've finished with it.
  To logout of a remote desktop session: 
- Navigate to the top left of the session window
- Click the System menu
- Select the Log Out menu item
- Navigate to the "Log out of this system now?" box in the middle of the session's desktop
- Click "Log Out".

* If you can't logout, please quit firefox before leaving your session.

Thanks everyone.
