[Students] Special Circumstances Guidance (for all students)
---------------
Dear all,

 

My apologies for not getting back to you with definitive guidance on procedures that will answer the questions you have raised so far and will allow you to raise additional questions. I am writing to you today on the matter of Special Circumstances.  The guidance on this is in preparation and is quite likely to include special provision to deal with covid-19 arrangements.  This is being decided across all the Schools in the University so it is a reasonably length process.  We will get back to you before the start of the examinations with advice on how to proceed that will take account of any special arrangements.  In the meantime, please do not submit Special Circumstance forms to your PT or the Student Support Team because the process is likely to change and we cannot give you details of the changes at the moment.

 

We know this is a difficult time due to the threat of covid-19 and the resulting disruption to arrangements. If you have concerns please feel free to contact your Personal Tutor or the Student Support Team (inf-sst@inf.ed.ac.uk <mailto:inf-sst@inf.ed.ac.uk> ). As soon as we have definitive guidance we will get back to you and hopefully this will reduce the level of uncertainty.  I hope you are safe and managing something approaching a normal life in these difficult circumstance

 

Thanks for your patience and cooperation,
