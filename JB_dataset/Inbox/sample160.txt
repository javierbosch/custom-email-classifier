Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Week 5 Homework
---------------
Dear students,

Please recall that, due to the ongoing Industrial Action, I have extended the deadline for the (electronic) submission of your Week 5 Homework to 21:00 pm tonight, Tuesday February 25. If you have not handed your Homework to your tutor at today's Workshops, please e-mail it to them; if they do not respond, or if they inform you that they do not accept Homework by e-mail, please submit through Turnitin, under the tab "Assessments" on the course Learn page.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you encounter any difficulties.

Best,

Nikola
