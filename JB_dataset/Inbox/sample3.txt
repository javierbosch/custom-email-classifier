[sys-announce] Machines in Forum server room
---------------

Unfortunately, there has been an increase in temperature in the
Forum server room. As a result, we have had to shutdown the GPU
servers based in the Forum without prior warning. We may also have
to shutdown other servers should the temperature continue to
increase.

Estates and Buildings have been notified but with no-one being
physically present in the building, we can give no estimate as yet
as to when the problem will be resolved. Please bear with us - we are
doing all we can to rectify this as quickly as we can.

Regards,

Alison
