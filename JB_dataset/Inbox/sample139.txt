Dear Students block 9 
  
The Domestic Supervisor shall be carrying out the inspection of your flat/bedroom from see dates below for further details.  
  
Inspections will be carried out between 10am and 2.30pm   
  
There are a number of reasons why we inspect the flats and your bedroom: • 
To pick up any repairs which may be needed • 
To meet with you to discuss any issues of importance to you regarding your tenancy • 
To monitor Health and Safety issues for staff and students in the flats • 
To check on the standard of cleaning • 
To check how you are looking after the property 
  
  
In order to keep inconvenience to you to a minimum, we shall bring keys for access in case you are not home. Please would you make sure that all your carpets are cleared of clothing and other items which might make it difficult for us to inspect them, and that all of the kitchen work surfaces are also cleared. 
  
  
Kind regards 
  
  
  
  
Domestic Team Supervisor 
Amanda Quin
