[ug-students] Appleton Tower Re-opened
---------------
Dear All

I’ve been informed by University Security that the engineer has been able to make a partial repair to the main AT door and a full repair to the side door near the Servitors’ room.  The building is therefore now open again. 

ALL ENTRY AND EXIT SHOULD BE MADE THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR. 

The main door is in a fragile state so whilst it is able to secure the building without a padlock it should not be used except in an emergency such as a fire evacuation. If this door is used unnecessarily there is a risk that the mechanism will break again. If this happens the building will be cleared and locked again. 
 
There are notices on the main door explaining these restrictions. Please pay attention to them. 

With best wishes 
Jane

	﻿Dear All,

	The Appleton Tower is currently closed due to a failure of the door system triggered by the high winds yesterday evening.  Whilst there is not an operational door mechanism the building has to be secured with padlocks which makes it unsafe for people to be inside (in case of an incident such as a fire).  An engineer is currently working on the doors trying to restore the automated mechanism and if he is successful the building will reopen later today.  But in the meantime it is not possible to grant anyone access.

	I appreciate that this may be disruptive to your plans but please be assured that Estates and Security are working hard to get the building open again as soon as possible.

	With best wishes,
	Jane
