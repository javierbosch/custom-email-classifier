[Students] Online game for discovering decision making strategies
---------------
Hi everyone!

I'm looking for participants to play an online game that I've developed as part of my final year Honours project.

The game has been designed to gather data on the different strategies people use when trying to discover and take rewarding actions.
The game involves several rounds, where each round you will have opportunities to make a choice, with the ultimate goal of getting the highest score you can. 

The game is available at the link below:
https://playthebandit.herokuapp.com/

(Due to limits on the free tier of the service used to host it, the game may take a few seconds to load) 

Participation is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any point. The game should take approximately 5-10 minutes - perfect if you want a quick break! I would be extremely grateful for your participation! 

Feel free to distribute this call, and please do not hesitate to email me at s1307311@sms.ed.ac.uk if you have any questions. 

The study is certified according to the Informatics Research Ethics Process, RT 4355. You can find the Participant Information Sheet on the first page of the game.

Thank you in advance for your help!
