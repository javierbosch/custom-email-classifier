[ug-students] Appleton Tower Closure
---------------
Dear All,

The Appleton Tower is currently closed due to a failure of the door system triggered by the high winds yesterday evening.  Whilst there is not an operational door mechanism the building has to be secured with padlocks which makes it unsafe for people to be inside (in case of an incident such as a fire).  An engineer is currently working on the doors trying to restore the automated mechanism and if he is successful the building will reopen later today.  But in the meantime it is not possible to grant anyone access.

I appreciate that this may be disruptive to your plans but please be assured that Estates and Security are working hard to get the building open again as soon as possible.

With best wishes,
Jane
