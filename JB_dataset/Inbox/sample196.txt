Dear All,

We're most grateful to all of you who have already replied, and
especially for the many thoughtful comments. If you haven't responded,
then please consider doing so this week!

A couple of comments in responses to what you've said so far:

(1) How will we feed back? This survey is part of a long and extremely
    onerous process, and the final document for that won't be
    published until November. However, for this student survey, we
    will aim to feed back to you a summary of the results and comments
    before the end of the semester.

(2) A few people have misconceptions about what "improving equality
    and diversity" means. The School does not practise positive
    discrimination based on protected characteristics in admission,
    assessment (obviously, as it's anonymous!), or indeed hiring of
    staff - it's illegal, so we couldn't even if we wanted to, which
    we don't.

    What we do want to do is (a) make sure we don't discriminate
    negatively - you might find it interesting to take the
    university's course on Unconscious Bias, which you can find on
    Learn; (b) try to ensure that the best people come here (as
    students or staff) despite societal pressures (arising from
    protected characteristics); (c) ensure that once people are
    here, they find us a good place to study or work.

Original mail follows:

We're writing to ask you to take a few minutes to respond to a *short*
(five minutes, though we'd love it if you took the time to write
comments too!) survey.

This survey is part of our process for Athena Swan, a programme which
aims to achieve equality of sex and gender in universities. Your
answers will help us to design an action plan over the coming years to
improve equality among our students. 

If you've been here a while, you may have done much longer such
surveys before - we're keeping this one brief, as we know you're busy.

There are four agree/disagree questions, two open-ended questions, and a free text box.  We especially welcome comments and suggestions!

Only UoE members have access to the survey, but your responses are anonymous. You can only answer once.

If you have any questions, reply to this message and Julian will
answer your question.

Thank you for helping the School to work towards an equal and diverse
environment!
