[sys-announce] remote desktop - you can help
---------------
If you use DICE via Microsoft Remote Desktop (or similar), this is for you.

Dear all,

The remote desktop servers are struggling, and you can help in three ways:

• When you finish work, please log out of DICE *before* quitting your Remote Desktop client. Otherwise your DICE session will continue overnight, and this can cause problems for other users. Logging out is explained at http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/how-to-logout-remote

• Use your new remote server instead of xrdp.inf.ed.ac.uk. For details see http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/remote-desktop#remote

• Taught students, please do coursework on your lab.inf.ed.ac.uk computer (instead of on a remote desktop server). For details see http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/remote-lab

Thank you!

Chris Cooke, Informatics computing.
