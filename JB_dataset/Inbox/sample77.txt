Proofs and Problem Solving (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Piazza
---------------
Hi PPS,

I have now enrolled everyone in the class on Piazza, you can find the PPS page here <https://piazza.com/class/k5exq5o5ur722f> . Please use this to discuss the reading, homework, and workshop problems together. There are a few more tutors monitoring Piazza to help answer questions. I will have Piazza open on my computer 2-5pm daily this week and will check in intermittently throughout the rest of the day.

Best,

Jonas
