[Students] Appleton Tower inaccessible
---------------
Dear All,
    
As you probably are already aware, the Appleton Tower has been occupied by students in support of the strike.  

This means that they are not allowing any staff into the building. We understand they aren't preventing students access. Currently we do not know if AT will be occupied for a day or two or for all the remaining strike days. Meanwhile timetabling are working to try and find alternative rooms for scheduled teaching.

Clearly this is an evolving situation and the School is doing what it can to ensure minimum disruption.

We are aware that the majority of students who are occupying the space are not on Informatics programmes and so hadnâ€™t necessarily understood the impact on students by occupying the space thinking that only the lecture theatres were important. 

Please don't get into dispute with the occupiers as we don't want the situation escalating.

We will update as we can as the University engages with the occupation.

Best,
Neil

Head of Student Services
