Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Industrial Action
---------------
Dear students,

You will have heard that the UCU has called for industrial action in Weeks 6, 7, and 8. Many of you will also have received an e-mail from the Head of School of Mathematics to that effect. As Course Organiser for CAP, I echo his sentiment that I will do my best to support your teaching and learning during the industrial action. In particular, I will help ensure that none of you are unfairly penalised as a result.

Specifically, I anticipate the effect of the industrial action on CAP to be as follows.

*	The lecturers who are due to give their Lectures in Weeks 6 through 11 have informed me that they will not participate in the industrial action; hence, Lectures will go ahead as scheduled. I would encourage you to continue attending your scheduled sessions, as you did before Flexible Learning Week.
*	A vast majority of Workshop tutors have informed me that they will continue tutoring and marking as usual. Hence, I would encourage you to continue attending Workshops as usual.
*	Correspondingly, I expect that most of you will be able to hand in Homework to tutors in Workshops, as usual. Some tutors who have disclosed their intention to participate in the industrial action have let me know that they will still be happy to accept Homework electronically, i.e. by e-mail.
*	Hence, if your tutor is taking industrial action, and is not present at your Workshop session, please submit your Homework to them by e-mail in a first instance. Please make the subject line of the e-mail read "CAP -- Week 5 Homework"; also, please submit your hand-in as a PDF file. Please note that tutors may either mark your Homework electronically or return a marked printed copy to you in due course; in any case, your marks will be duly recorded.
*	I have instructed tutors who are not willing to mark e-mailed Homework during the action to inform you accordingly, and minimally by auto-reply; in that case, please submit your hand-in through the course Learn pages: we have set up a Turnitin assignment, called "Week 5 Homework", under the tab "Assessments". (Please note that similar arrangements will be made for all remaining Homework assignments that are affected by the action.)
*	I have set an extended deadline for the electronic submission of Homework -- be it by e-mail or through Turnitin -- to 21:00 on the Tuesday of the corresponding Workshop.

I realise that some of you may be uncomfortable with crossing picket lines, and I respect your right to decide not to do so. In that case, please note that

*	you should feel free to watch live streams, or recordings, of Lectures;
*	you may submit your Homework electronically to your tutor, either by e-mail or through Turnitin.

I am aware that the uncertainty caused by the industrial action may be causing you stress or anxiety. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have. As it is difficult to predict the exact impact of the action on any one of you, I will be happy to consider individual queries on a case-by-case basis.

Best,

Nikola
