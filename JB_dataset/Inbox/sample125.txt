Informatics 1 - Object Oriented Programming (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Assignment Deadline and Marking
---------------
Hi all,

this is a reminder about the deadline of the second part of the assignment which is this Friday at 4pm sharp!

I plan to release the feedback shortly after the deadline to everyone, so there can be no extension for this.

There is no percentage split between the last two parts of the assignment. Instead, a criteria-based marking scheme is used and submissions for both parts are evaluated collectively for each student. That means, a submission for Part II is definitely required to achieve at least a pass for this course. You can see the full marking scheme at the end of each assignment paper.


I still see that about 40% have not yet submitted anything. I strongly urge you to do that in time!

If for any personal or health reasons, you are unable to submit anything by the deadline, please get in touch with your PT regarding the special circumstances procedure.

Cheers

Volker
