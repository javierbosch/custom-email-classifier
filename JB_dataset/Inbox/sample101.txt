Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: The last chapter

Hi Everyone,

I hope you have been enjoying CAP so far.  I will be taking over next Monday until the Thursday of Week 11 to study Chapter 8. 

The mathematics has a different flavour to most of CAP and will be covering things which you are unlikely to have seen in School.   

We will be using Top Hat quite a lot to work on our understanding during lectures, so do come prepared with a suitable device. 

The Reading Quiz due this Wednesday will cover only Chapter 8.1 (and NOT also 8.2 as advertised on the original course information).   

I will be releasing reading guides and schedules for the rest of Chapter 8 soon. (They are not changing hugely from what they were before, but they are a bit more detailed.)

If you have any problems, do get in touch with me.  Best is after lectures, in workshops (I am usually in the  9am and 10.30 am sessions), via Piazza or by email.   

I look forward to seeing you all next Monday and working together with you  on understanding some important and challenging mathematics.  

 Toby Bailey
