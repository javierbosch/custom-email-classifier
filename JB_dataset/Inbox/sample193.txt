[sys-announce] Network server reboot
---------------
We need to reboot one of the Forum network servers for a kernel upgrade.  
This will take place at 13:00 today.  You're unlikely to notice this.

However...

If you have a self-managed machine which has a dynamic leased address AND it
tries to renew its DHCP lease during the couple of minutes or so that this
reboot takes then it will fail and oyou might then lose connectivity.  If
you're unlucky enough to hit this combination then just wait a couple of
minutes and retry.

Managed Windows and Linux users, and self-managed users with static 
addresses won't be affected at all.  We have multiple DHCP servers covering 
these groups.
