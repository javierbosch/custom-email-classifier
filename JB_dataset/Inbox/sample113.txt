Informatics 1 - Object Oriented Programming (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Coursework Part II extension and tutorials next week
---------------
Hi all,

thanks for your patience. My TA, computing support and I are working on fixing the problem with the inaccessible feedback interface. We likely need today and potentially the weekend to get this done and available to you again.

That means, the deadline for the second part of the assignment is hereby extended to Friday the 13th of March, 4pm. The extra week should hopefully give everybody enough time to catch up with the time (and sleep) lost over this.

This extension has a bit of a domino effect regarding the tutorials. Since feedback won't be released before the new deadline, discussing it next week is not sensible. I can also not offer a different topic during the tutorials since I have not taught the material that far yet. Therefore, the tutorial schedule will change as follows:

- There are no tutorials next week. (9th - 13th of March)

- The feedback for Part II tutorial will happen a week later. (16th - 20th of March)

- The Object Design and SVN tutorial will be combined to one. (23rd - 27th of March)

Lastly, Part III of the assignment will still be released on Monday, so there will be a bit of a cross-over. However, considering that you have four weeks for Part III in total, I believe it is still enough time for you to get this done.

Thanks again for your patience with this and I will get back to you once this is resolved and the system is accessible again.

Cheers

Volker

PS: It is actually an interesting problem causing the accessibility issue and I am happy to tell you all about it during next week's lecture.
