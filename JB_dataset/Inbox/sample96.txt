Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Homework -- Marking
---------------
Dear students,

Some of you have expressed concern over their Homework marks for Weeks 5 and 6 not being visible, in spite of you having handed in electronically. Please rest assured that your submissions have been recorded, and that they will be accounted for by tutors once the Industrial Action is concluded. In particular, any missed marking will be made up for in due course.

As always, please do not hesitate to contact me with any remaining questions or concerns.

Best,

Nikola
