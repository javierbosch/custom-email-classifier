Re: [ug1-students] Examination arrangements in School of Informatics

Dear All,
I’ve had a good number of really useful and interesting questions - thank you all.  I’m working on answers now and will circulate them today.  So, if you can, please don’t send further questions until I’ve sent my list of answers because it may be the case that your question has already been asked and I have an answer.  Thanks in advance for your help with this.

Yours,
Stuart.

	Dear Informatics students and students taking informatics courses as an outside course,
	
	We know this is a stressful time for you all and the earlier we can get you information the better.  However, it is often necessary to wait until the information is reasonably reliable, so you have a sound basis on which to plan.  Over the past week there has been intensive discussion within the University on how best to approach assessment that is reliable, fair and compassionate.  Vice-principal Harmon has circulated the definitive University position today.  The aim of this message is to provide details on how the School of Informatics is implementing the measures outlined by Vice-principal Harmon.
	
	Examination Arrangements

	*	Undergraduate, years 1 and 2: There will be no main examination or formal resit examination diet.  You should keep working on your coursework and submit everything you can.  More detail will be available shortly in the FAQ.
	*	Undergraduate years 3-5 and MSc students:

		*	There will be examinations, and these will follow the published examination timetable but they will take place online.
		*	All examinations are “open book” in the sense that you can use personal notes, course materials and any previously existing published information source you choose to inform your answer.
		*	However, you must work on the examination papers independently without interacting with other individuals.  You will be asked to acknowledge an “own work” declaration for the examination that states you will not collaborate with other individuals in answering the paper.
		*	The examinations will be similar to on-campus examinations.   
		*	The examinations will be made available via the LEARN virtual learning environment. 
		*	Papers for examinations scheduled to run from 0930-1130 in the examination timetable will be available from 0800 on LEARN.  Papers for exams scheduled to run from 1430-1630 in the examination timetable will be available from 1300 on LEARN.  
		*	Students are permitted to work on their answers in the 5-hour interval starting when the paper becomes available.  This is in place to ease issues arising from students working in different timezones.
		*	Students are strongly recommended to work on the examination for any two hours within the five-hour interval.  
		*	Once you have written your answers, you will have one hour to upload your answers.  So, for example, if you start at 1100 and finish at 1300, you must upload before 1400.
		*	You will be able to upload your answers to LEARN using a range of commonly used file types, including photographs of handwritten answers.
		*	We will establish a “practice” course in LEARN that will allow you to rehearse what you need to do to sit an examination remotely.
		*	We will also be in touch to identify those with obstacles to the completion of the examinations.  For example, students with schedules of adjustment or students who cannot access LEARN adequately from home.
		*	We have one honours/MSc course whose examination is cancelled.  This is PDIoT which has a substantial coursework component.

	
	Safety Net
	
	In section 3 of the Vice-Principal’s email he details the “safety net” that will operate for the honours examinations. 
	
	In his email he uses the term “significant” in relation to coursework.  In the School of Informatics, we will interpret “significant coursework” as coursework that has covered the majority of the learning outcomes of the course.
	
	The provisions of this "safety net" ensure that the examination can only improve your situation.  Here is a summary:

	*	For courses where there is already significant coursework, your percentage mark as a proportion of the coursework score will be used a “floor” below which your combined exam and coursework score will not be allowed to fall.
	*	In the case of courses where there is not significant coursework, a poor performance in the examination will result in the course being discounted from your year average which is used to determine your degree classification.

	
	
	We acknowledge that there will still be further questions, and this email does not fully specify what will happen in all circumstances so we welcome questions that will help clarify the situation further.  We have prepared a FAQ for First and Second year that will appear shortly and another for Undergraduate years 3-5 and MSc.
	
	Best Regards,
