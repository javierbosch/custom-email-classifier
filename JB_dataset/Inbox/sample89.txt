Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: COVID-19 -- Weeks 10 and 11
---------------
Dear students,

I hope that you are well and that you are staying safe, wherever you are.

After consultation with the Mathematics Teaching Organisation and the CAP course team, I am implementing the following contingencies for delivery and assessment of the course going forward into Weeks 10 and 11.

Lectures: Toby Bailey, who was scheduled to deliver Lectures on Chapter 8 of the textbook, will create a suite of screencasts on the relevant material which will be made available to you through Learn; it is expected that the first batch of these screencasts, on Sections 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3, will be published early in Week 10. You should access screencasts for self-study in your own time; questions on the material should be posted to Piazza.

Workshops: Worksheets for Weeks 10 and 11 will be published as scheduled, i.e., on Tuesday mornings of those weeks; the Week 9 Worksheet has already been published. In the absence of Workshops, these Worksheets are to be used for self-study; worked solutions will be published as usual. Tutors will provide enhanced support through Piazza; I have created folders for your questions ("week_?_worksheet"). Based on those, the course team will create screencasts to help guide you through the Worksheets. Specific guidance on how you can get the most out of Piazza is in preparation.

Homework: I have extended the deadlines for the submission of Homework by a week each; hence,

*	the Week 8 Homework is now due by 21:00pm (GMT) on Tuesday, March 24; 
*	the Week 9 Homework is due by 21:00pm (GMT) on Tuesday, March 31; 
*	the Week 10 Homework is due by 21:00pm (GMT) on Tuesday, April 7.

By default, Homework should be submitted through Turnitin, via the course Learn page; if you encounter any difficulties in the process, please e-mail your tutor or myself. 

Finally, I am changing the assessment rules, with the best 6 out of 10 Homework assignments now counting towards your grade, in an attempt to help alleviate pressures on those of you who may be unable to submit Homework.

Online Quizzes: I am extending the deadlines for the submission of all Online Quizzes by a week each; hence,

*	the Week 9 Reading Quiz is now due by 23:59pm (GMT) on Wednesday, March 25;
*	the Week 10 Reading Quiz is due by 23:59pm (GMT) on Wednesday, April 1; 
*	the Week 9 Skill Quiz is due by 23:59pm (GMT) on Sunday, March 29; 
*	the Week 10 Skill Quiz is due by 23:59pm (GMT) on Sunday, April 5; 
*	the Week 11 Skill Quiz is due by 23:59pm (GMT) on Sunday, April 12.

As above, I am changing the assessment rules, with the best 6 out of 10 Reading Quizzes and the best 8 out of 12 Skill Quizzes counting towards your grade. Finally, with immediate effect, I am removing all caps on the number of attempts you are given; in other words, you may attempt each quiz as often as you like.

The above measures are designed to allow you to continue to engage with the course and the -- interesting and important! -- material in your own time without placing undue pressures on you in these uncertain times. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns; in particular, and as I have done in the past, I will be happy to adjust any deadlines on a case-by-case basis, as required.

Best,

Nikola
