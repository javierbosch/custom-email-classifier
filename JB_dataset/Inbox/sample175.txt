[ug-students] Appleton Tower Level -1 Entrance
---------------
Dear All,
	The large doors on level -1 of Appleton Tower are disabled by the high wind speeds.  Please use the revolving door.  There is also an entrance accessible down the passage to the right hand side of the revolving door.  The main doors have been locked and a notice will be posted on the main doors.  When the wind abates the door should become operational again.

Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

Yours,
	Stuart.
