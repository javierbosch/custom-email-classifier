Dear All,


I’ve received several messages about Covid19 and precautions within the School and University.


The current advice from the University is that we should operate as normal.  That advice is reviewed on a regular basis as health and safety remain a high priority for the University, but equally we want to minimise disruption to education and other functions in the University.


The University’s health and safety website contains advice on travel and self-isolation and is updated as new information becomes available.


Within the School I would encourage anyone who is unwell not to come into work.  Even if you are sure that this is not Covid19, at this time your presence may cause anxiety and distress amongst colleagues so I would urge you to stay at home and recover before coming back into the Forum, Bayes or the Appleton Tower.


For those at work please follow the public health advice to wash hands frequently.


I believe that the University will be mailing all staff and students later today but I wanted to send this message in the meantime.


With best wishes,
Jane
