[Students] Blessings to China card at Forum desk
---------------

Dear all:

You will all know about the Coronavirus crisis affecting China (and  
elsewhere).
Almost everyone in Informatics will know someone in China or
works/studies with someone with relatives in China.

There are two cards at the Informatics Forum entry desk.
We invite you to sign one to show your personal solidarity with our
wonderful Chinese students and staff during this difficult time.

The card's greeting reads

????

Zhùfú zh?ngguó


which translates as "Blessing China" - a traditional greeting of well-wishing.

Please do take a few moments to visit the Informatics Forum entry desk.
I know that every signature will be warmly appreciated.

Best wishes, Bob
Equality & Diversity
