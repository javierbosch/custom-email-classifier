Informatics 1 - Object Oriented Programming (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Inf1B Assignment Part III due today 4pm
---------------
Hi all,

I hope you all are well and healthy. This is a reminder that the third and last part of the Inf1B assignment is due today at 4pm British time.

I received several emails from students asking me about extensions. Unfortunately, I have nothing to do with granting those. You will have to contact the ITO about this via the channels described in the submission section of the last assignment paper.

all the best

Volker
