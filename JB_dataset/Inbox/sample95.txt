Re: [ug-students] [Students] Covid-19 update

Dear Joāo,

Thank you for your message.  I am copying other taught students in my reply as many of them may have the same concerns.  I am also copying in the Director of Learning and Teaching, Stuart Anderson, and the Head of Student Services, Neil Heatley, so that they can follow up if they have anything to add.

Any individual who becomes ill will be able to apply for an extension in the usual way, and if appropriate submit a special circumstances claim. To avoid people visiting their doctor unnecessarily the University has said that it will take other evidence or self-declaration. There are no predefined limits on the length of illness/extension, but we have to balance the impact on the rest of the class since marked work can not be returned until all extensions have passed.  My understanding is that for most people, without an underlying health problem, they recover from coronavirus in a week.   As with any illness if it is protracted or very serious it may be more appropriate to not submit a coursework and only apply for special circumstances, where the committee do have the discretion to ignore missing marks when the circumstances merit it.

At the moment the University does not envisage closing but we are constantly monitoring the situation.  So yes, we are considering alternatives to the exams being conducted in the usual manner in April/May.  We are still aiming to allow students to graduate or progress in the summer but until it becomes clearer how severe the outbreak in Scotland is going to be it is not possible to make any definitive statements.

With best wishes,
Jane

	Dear Dr. Jane Hillston, 

	Thank you for this important email. It is very important to maintain regular contact with the community with updates. As a student, I have a few questions that I believe are important especially for planning purposes.

	Coursework extensions in case of sickness or quarantine needed: It is common for the sick to remain sick for over 1 week and even over 2 weeks. Will extension limits accommodate all the sick periods regardless of duration?
	Exams: Is there at the moment the risk of exams not being done? Is there an alternative being studied? Should I, as a student keep my summer free for possible exam delays?

	These are currently questions that I have as a student and that some of my friends also have. Could your clarify any of this?

	Best Regards,
	João Catarino

		Dear All, 

		You will be aware that the situation is evolving fast with respect to the Covid-19 outbreak in the UK and internationally.  
		In the University and in the School we continue to develop plans for a number of different scenarios, but for the moment the advice remains that the University is open for “business as usual” albeit with a few additional precautions.

		The University Covid19 coordination group is led by Tracey Slaven, the University Deputy Secretary and I believe she will be issuing an update shortly. Meanwhile your questions may be answered if you look at https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/communicable-infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus.  This website is updated on a regular basis.  In addition up-to-date advice from the Scottish Government can be found at: https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/

		For the moment the primary objective is containment so I would encourage you all to 

		*	Wash hands regularly; there is now soap available in all the kitchens in the Forum, and there will be soap available in the kitchen in AT shortly.  We are awaiting a delivery of hand sanitiser but dispensers will be distributed across the buildings as soon as they are available.
		*	If you are feeling unwell do not come into work, even if it is simply a cold.  You should stay at home; if you are well enough you can work at home.  For staff, absences should be reported to your line manager in the usual way.
		*	Should you become unwell during the day please go home; again staff should report to their line manager.  By preference do not use public transport, but this may be unavoidable.
		*	In the coming days and weeks we may reach a situation where schools will be closed; in those circumstances parents will mostly need to stay at home to look after their children. This may be disruptive, but you should be re-assured that the University will almost certainly grant extra ‘special/family leave’ in these circumstances.
		*	Avoid situations where food is shared (eg pizza lunches, etc) unless it is individually packaged.


		Travel:  the University advice is that travel to ‘non-specified’ destinations can go ahead, but the situation and advice is evolving rapidly.  Given this I think that it is wise to only make essential trips and where possible use alternative arrangements such as teleconferencing. 

		Interviews: The School is just about to embark on several weeks of selection panels for new members of academic staff.  For the moment we are assuming these are going ahead but also making provision for remote selection for candidates who are unable to travel.  Whilst feasible I would ask you still to participate by attending talks when possible.

		If anyone is organising an event, other than the interviews, that plans to bring people to Edinburgh in the coming weeks please can they get in touch.

		With best wishes,
		Jane
