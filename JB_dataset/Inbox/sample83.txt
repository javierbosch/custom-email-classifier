[Students]  Mandelbrot Maps, Fractal explorer
---------------
Hi!

I'm currently looking for people to try out and critique my 4th year honours project; an interactive fractal explorer built using WebAssembly. It is available to try here mmaps.freddiejbawden.com <http://mmaps.freddiejbawden.com> .


I have a short feedback questionaire (10 multiple choice questions) for you complete if you wish. Responses are anonymous so you can be as mean as you want! The form is available here; mmaps.freddiejbawden.com/feedback <http://mmaps.freddiejbawden.com/feedback> .




This study was certified according to the Informatics Research Ethics Process, RT number 2019/17630. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. 


Thanks in advance!

Freddie, 4th Year Comp Sci
