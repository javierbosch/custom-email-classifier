Calculus and its Applications (2019-2020)[SEM2]: Chapter 8: Online Quizzes
---------------
It has been correctly pointed out on Piazza that the subject matter of the Week 10 reading test  is not as advertised on the assessments page on Learn.   I apologise for this oversight.  

The underlying problem is that the online quiz materials that I inherited from previous years seem not to be entirely in line with the syllabus and the sequence in the textbook.  I had intended to improve these, but with all the changes caused by Covid-19 arrangements, I have not managed to do this. 

I have extended the time limits for the Week 10 Reading quiz and the outstanding skills quizzes.  All these can be attempted an unlimited number of times (with your best attempt counting). I have also provided lists making clear which section of the textbook each question relates to.    I suggest attempting relevant questions from these quizzes as you need them, in association with studying the relevant sections of the  book and the associated screencasts.    You can then make a final "revision" attempt at the quizzes closer to their closing date. 

Please keep asking questions on Piazza. 

Sorry again for any confusion. 

Toby
